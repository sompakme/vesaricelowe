His first phrase of Boyz II Men's "It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday" <a href=#>immediately intrigued</a> Levine, Stefani and Williams, with Shelton following suit after hearing his controlled R&B stylings.

When Shelton started enticing the singer with his regional connection, to Williams' dismay, the seasoned coach pulled out a beige-colored parody of the newbie's voluminous hat, complete with a sheriff's star. "How hard is it gonna be when he's making you a heartfelt speech and you're waiting for him to make you an Arby's roast beef sandwich?" teased Shelton.

Though Shelton noted there wasn't much finesse, Levine noted she had plenty of "spectacular" moments, Stefani offered to help her find her musical identity and Williams applauded her vocal risks. She joined Team Adam.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.45847750865052><h2>Chris Jamison</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Chris_Jamison_The_Voice_Season_7.jpg><p>The Pittsburgh triplet, now a campus mailman and rock ensemble singer, <a href=# rel=noopener>became a four-chair turn</a> on&nbsp;<strong>John Mayer's&nbsp;</strong>"Gravity."

Though both complimented his guitar abilities, and though Butler said before his audition that he'd side with Shelton, he went with Levine.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.48858447488584><h2>Jonathan Wyndham</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jonathan_Wyndham_The_Voice_Season_7.jpg><p>The quirky South Carolina native conquered his speech impediment through music, and has done session work and songwriting (and hopes to continue hitting every Cracker Barrel location while on the road). <a href=#>He covered</a> A Great Big World's "Say Something" and started shaking when he saw he had wooed all four judges (included a nearly teary Stefani).

Levine praised her individuality and Shelton predicted her success, and though Williams remained standing the entire time, and Stefani tried&nbsp;<span>her hardest —&nbsp;</span>"Do you like clothes? I have so many clothing lines, it's crazy! I can hook you up, I can so hook you up!" — she picked Levine.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1><h2>Team Blake</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Blake_Shelton_The_Voice.jpg><p><strong>Blake Shelton</strong> returns for his seventh season, with three championships under his belt and Little Big Town as his guest mentors.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.3649825783972><h2>Allison Bray</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Allison_Bray_The_Voice.jpg><p>After not making it past her pitchy blind audition in season six, the new high school graduate sharpened her skills by starting a band. <a href=#>Despite the three-chair turn on</a>&nbsp;<strong>Kacey Musgraves'</strong>&nbsp;"Merry Go 'Round," Shelton felt he had it in the bag as he complimented her breath control and refreshing sound; he even told Stefani, "Don't speak," quoting her band's hit. Though Stefani touted the possibilities of trying an offbeat collaborator by showcasing her musical synergy with Williams, and Levine tried to just piss Shelton off, Bray stuck with the country coach.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.9583333333333><h2>James David Carter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/James_David_Carter_The_Voice.jpg><p>After the sports star suffered an injury, the now-working musician has opened for<strong> Brad Paisley</strong>,<strong> Trace Adkins</strong> and Shelton himself, when he had a mullet. The unanimously pleasing auditionee, <a href=#>who sang</a> "Nobody Knows," hilariously thanked Stefani for teaching him how to spell the word "bananas" (in reference to her "Hollaback Girl" track), and Stefani and Levine competed to see who could stand tallest on their big red chairs. Shelton said he's been drinking too much to try it himself, but he spotlighted his country genre expertise — enough to nab Carter.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8902743142145><h2>Reagan James</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Reagan_James_a_p.jpg><p>The incredibly poised Texas teen <a href=#>put her textured sound</a> on <strong>Ed&nbsp;Sheeran's</strong> "Give Me Love," triggering another Shelton-Stefani showdown. James revealed that she wants to pursue R&B, which drenched Williams in regret: "Speaking from a missed opportunity, you are such a threat to the game!" Still, she went with the hometown favorite, Shelton. Only time will tell if she doesn't turn country.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9577464788732><h2>Taylor Brashears</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Taylor_Brashears_a_p.jpg><p>The Nashville food-truck worker grew up playing the fiddle, and led a "retro-country" band immediately after high school. She <a href=# rel=noopener>put her sass</a> on <strong>Loretta Lynn's</strong>&nbsp;"You Ain't Woman Enough (to Take My Man)" and intrigued Shelton at the very last second — a move he explained was because Lynn is one of the untouchable choices of singing competitions, like <strong>Whitney Houston</strong>. "Break the mold!" shouted Levine, asking her to not go with the country coach, while Williams praised her swagger and offered to learn in order to coach her. Still, she chose Shelton.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Bree Fondacaro</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Bree_Fondacaro_The_Voice_Season_7.jpg><p>With a ton of rasp, the Orange County native and the daughter of the music teacher, <a href=#>championed</a><strong> Bob Dylan's </strong>"It Ain't Me Babe"&nbsp;and got Shelton to turn his chair.

"I'm thinkin' this is a good lookin' man," complimented Shelton immediately, also praising his laid-back attitude. Williams praised his technical abilities, and Stefani called his voice "delicious." Levine endorsed Shelton (for the first time on the series?), and Martin followed.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1.76><h2>Kensington Moore</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kensington_Moore_The_Voice_Season_7.jpg><p>The singer <a href=#>joined</a> Shelton's team.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.8526703499079><h2>Craig Wayne Boyd</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Craig_Wayne_Boyd_The_Voice_Season_7.jpg><p>The&nbsp;<span>Nashville&nbsp;</span>songwriter, now a single father, <a href=#>went full-on country</a> with the&nbsp;<strong>Travis&nbsp;Tritt</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Marty Stuart&nbsp;</strong>song, "The Whiskey Ain't&nbsp;Workin." Though Williams didn't know the song, he pressed his button to compliment a couple of his soulful ad&nbsp;libs, a comment to which Shelton praised his fellow coach, "How&nbsp;<span>incredible</span>&nbsp;is it that he doesn't know a song, but he still knows when you're&nbsp;ad-libbing?" Shelton highlighted Boyd's song choice, and said, "Let's turn&nbsp;The Voice&nbsp;into a&nbsp;honky-tonk!" Boyd went with Shelton.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1.7209302325581><h2>Grand Ganzer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Grant_Ganzer_The_Voice_Season_7.jpg><p>Shelton <a href=#>landed</a>&nbsp;<strong>Grand&nbsp;Ganzer.</strong></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.9578313253012><h2>Tanner Linford</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Tanner_Linford_The_Voice_Season_7.jpg><p>The teenage returning&nbsp;auditionee&nbsp;was incredibly shaky when trying out for season 6 with a Rihanna ballad, but <a href=#>went this time</a> with <strong>Alison Krauss'</strong>&nbsp;"When You Say Nothing At All" (and a bit of a lower voice, thanks to puberty). Just when it was a lost cause, Shelton turned at the last second and kept him on the show.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.94297352342159><h2>Fernanda Bosch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fernanda_Bosch_The_Voice_Season_7.jpg><p>The teenage music group founder from Miami — who also teaches kids with down syndrome how to swim — <a href=#>tried her raspy vocal tricks</a> on the&nbsp;<strong>Macy Gray&nbsp;</strong>hit "I Try" (though with a bit of awkward stage presence), and triggered yet another Stefani-Shelton showdown (who knew these two had such similar tastes?). Shelton praised her "sandpaper" sound, but Stefani connected with her on a personal level. Though Levine told Shelton to give up, Bosch opted for the country coach. &nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.49186046511628><h2>Justin Johnes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Justin_Johnes_The_Voice_Season_7.jpg><p>The fifteen-year-old YouTube sensation tried his hand at a live performance for the first time, and nabbed the last spot of the season by <a href=#>putting</a> his&nbsp;<strong>Justin Bieber</strong>&nbsp;sound on the&nbsp;<strong>Passenger&nbsp;</strong>hit "Let Her Go." Despite Levine's jabs — "Blake has pieces of steak in his colon that are older than you are!" — Shelton counted his lucky stars and gave his final contestant a shirt of his own, which read "Blake's Boo."</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1.5><h2>Team Pharrell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Pharrell_Williams_The_Voice.jpg><p><strong>Pharrell Williams</strong> joins the show for his first season, with <strong>Alicia Keys</strong> as his guest mentor.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9025423728814><h2>Luke Wade</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Luke_Wade_The_Voice.jpg><p>The soulful son of a painter and a dancer lost his vision in one eye in a paintball accident, but the band frontman <a href=#>enticed all the coaches</a> with endless runs on "That's How Strong My Love Is" that got Levine standing on his chair. Williams name-dropped <strong>Robin Thicke</strong> and<strong> Justin Timberlake</strong>, Stefani touted her band experience, and Levine and Shelton noted their previous show wins. In the end, the season's first auditionee went with Williams, who knows soul best.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8578680203046><h2>Elyjuh Rene</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Elyjuh_Rene_The_Voice.jpg><p><a href=#>The self-proclaimed "momma's boy"&nbsp;tackled</a><strong> Beyonce's</strong> "XO" with unique but natural phrasing. Shelton was visibly surprised when he turned to find a guy onstage, one who was tearing up after the performance. Williams described him as "anointed" and Levine called the audition "blissful," but Williams debuted the power of personal encouragement: "Have you not had to fight all your life? Did you not just sing that onstage just now? I rest my case," he said. It was effective enough, as Rene chose the "Happy" coach. Shelton congratulated Williams, "You Barbara Walters'd his ass."</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9189765458422><h2>Danica Shirey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Danica_Shirey_a_p.jpg><p>The Pennsylvania mother loves singing R&B and won the Apollo's talent show when she was fifteen years old.

Levine touted his two wins, while Stefani offered to help with her image. "He's so fit and I'm so scrawny, but I know what to do with that voice," said Williams, who compared her to a snake charmer and won her over.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.3923841059603><h2>Maiya Sykes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Maiya_Sykes_a_p.jpg><p>The Yale graduate (a triple major!) comes from a musical family; her father is an versatile instrumentalist and her mother sang backup for Earth, Wind & Fire and <strong>Neil Diamond</strong>.

Among endless compliments from each of the coaches from their respective angles, Williams stood up and intrigued her with lines like "I'm only going to push your ambitions, not mine," while Stefani bragged about her fashion sense: "I can get you shoes, handbags — I have access to goods!"

"I got some good news for you man — we all turned around!" revealed Levine. Stefani compared his voice to Williams' (which triggered a love fest between the two new coaches), Williams complimented his genre-mixing audition, Shelton touted his Nashville roots (where Offor went to college) and Levine praised his ability to recover from initial missteps.
