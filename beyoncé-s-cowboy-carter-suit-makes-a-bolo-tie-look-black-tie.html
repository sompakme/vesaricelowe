In the photos, Beyoncé wears a black, avant-garde tuxedo. Instead of a bow tie, she tied a shiny black ribbon around her collar, with a string of diamonds hanging down the center.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JqDyaFgEGQxykFBBAdeS34-1920-80.webp><p>The jacket, custom Givenchy, has an almost kimono-esque wrap fit, fastened with what looks like the top of a padlock and layered over her crisp white button-down shirt. Her black, point-toe, patent-leather platform stiletto heels peek out from under her flared trousers.</p><p>Bey was dressed by her long-time stylist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/shionat/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Shiona Turini</a>.

But, because of that experience, I did a deeper dive into the history of Country music and studied our rich musical archive. It feels good to see how music can unite so many people around the world, while also amplifying the voices of some of the people who have dedicated so much of their lives educating on our musical history."</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
