"It was just I had a problem, man. And it took me out, and if it wasn't for me having good people around me, I'd be where Elvis [Presly] is, John Belushi is, [Chris] Farley. I'm grateful. I don't even trip. It got to that point where I had to do something and life circumstances would come along... and you'll throw caution to the wind to warnings. I seen the warnings all around my neighborhood. I seen addicts all my life.&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I seen people with alcohol problems all my life. All my life. And people would sit me down and say don't you do that, and it wasn't a conscious decision.</a> It was just one of them things where there was a lot of opportunities available to me and I was in an emotional space where I was dependent on those things to help me deal with the present reality."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">He admitted that Keenan Ivory Wayans, the creator of&nbsp;In Living Color, along with others pulled him to the side to urge him to get help. After he left for a time Davidson did return to the show, but the cast had made a few changes while he was gone<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">. He said "there was a lack of quality to the show"</a> at that point and that he missed the friendship he'd formed.
