"So a lot of it is energy and humor and being genuine. I will say I’ve always connected more with people who are really in touch with their emotions."</p><p>The "Espresso" singer is reportedly dating Irish actor <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/barry-keoghan/>Barry Keoghan</a>, known best for his roles in Dunkirk, Saltburn and The Banshees of Inisherin.

"When I meet people that feel very genuine and pure, I hope to keep them in my life. Because that’s the only way that I’m going to stay close to the ground in any capacity. But also, part of learning is keeping the wrong people in your life for a period of time. I’ve learned that lesson the hard way a couple of times, for sure."</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

"The relationships that I actually want to put my energy into have to be so interesting or invigorating because they take me away from the other things I love.”</p><p>Just as important (if not more so) to Carpenter is her friendships. The singer and actress says "it's nice to have friends in the industry you feel like you can trust."</p><p>"You need to have people who have been through similar things and can be a normal friend and just happen to have this job as well," she continued.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGirkZe%2FqrrAZpqaqqCau7Wx0WapqKWRo8Gqr4ypmKusnpq%2FbsDRmqCtq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
