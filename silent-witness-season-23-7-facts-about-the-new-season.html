Although it looks like suicide, Nikki is convinced that it was actually murder, and staged to look like otherwise. The case also stirs up difficult memories from Nikki's childhood.

William Gaminara made it to second place as Leo Dalton, with ten series of the hit show under his belt. He left the series back in season 16, and made a guest appearance in season 20. Richard Lintern is currently the shortest serving cast member, having joined the show for season 17, but even he has already starred in seven series, impressive!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/efcc53d3ce1a-silent-w-1-z.jpg><h2>The new series is filmed in London</h2><p id=eiQMvXNyWDsR data-wc=108>Although the show has looked at crimes taking place all over the country, the new series will be based primarily in London. Richard Lintern previously told Radio Times: "I think there was a conscious decision taken on this particular series of Silent Witness to focus on London, to bring London more in as a character than it’s been before. And I think that’s coincidental with the advent of drone photography which has allowed you aerial access to cities in a much cheaper and more cost efficient way than it used to be." The show is filmed in areas including Westminster, Richmond, Camden, Southwark, Camden, Hackney, Kensington and Chelsea.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/940ac62fd7be-silent-5-z.jpg><h2>The creator is a former murder squad detective</h2><p id=eGcVyfp7qcil data-wc=57>Nigel McCrery really knows what he is talking about in the show – because he was once a murder squad detective himself. As a member of the Nottinghamshire Constabulary, he worked on murder cases before retiring aged 34 after injuring his back. He then went to Cambridge University, and upon graduating he joined the BBC's Graduate Scheme.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/01b3c34f318a-silent-2-z.jpg><h2>The show has been going for 24 years</h2><p id=edoYpm6iHD_L data-wc=65>The drama has been on British television for a very long time, and has an impressive 24-year series run so far! The show has had more time on air than&nbsp;other hit series including Jonathan Creek, Midsomer Murders and Only Fools and Horses. Chatting on This Morning, Emilia said: "It's a great cast and a great crew, and the production values are still so high."</p><p id=eBmxNUZuGGuq data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Silent Witness 2020: Meet the cast of series 23</a></strong></p><h2>Emilia Fox's brother is also currently starring in a crime drama</h2><p id=eCPfQieEWvai data-wc=65>Like sister, like brother!
