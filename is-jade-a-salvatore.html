However, at a young age, she discovered she's a ripper, prone to losing control when drinking, and even seeing, human blood, making her stronger and emotionally unstable.<h2>Do hope and Josie end up together?</h2>He does not break off the relationship with Josie, however despite the problems and his newfound knowledge. Hope eventually decides not to pursue Landon any more, allowing him to be happy in his relationship with Josie.<h2>Why did hope and Landon break up?</h2>After he stabs Clark (Nick Fink) and eats Cleo, Hope realizes that he's actually Malivore. The mud monster likely hijacked Landon's body in the prison world and used him as a vessel to get out. And knowing Hope is the only one who could kill him, he broke up with her to keep his distance.<h2>Who is Wendy in Legacies?</h2>Ronni Hawk is an American actress who portrays Wendy in the second season of Legacies.<h2>Does Lizzie become a vampire?</h2>Her dad, Alaric (Matthew Davis), is in a coma and currently trapped in the limbo of Purgatory; her sister, Josie (Kaylee Bryant), left the Salvatore School (and the show), and Lizzie herself turned into a vampire during her quest to kill Hope (Danielle Rose Russell).<h2>Are Lizzie and Josie witches?</h2>Josie is the daughter of Caroline Forbes (Candice King, a Vampire Diaries cast member who has yet to appear on Legacies) and Alaric Saltzman (Matthew Davis), and she and her twin sister Lizzie (Jenny Boyd) are powerful witches.<h2>Who is Kai Parker Legacies?</h2>Kai Parker is a vampire, or more specifically, a heretic<p>After Kai took his own life, he awoke in transition, and, after drinking his father's human blood, turned himself into an immortal vampire/witch hybrid, known as a heretic.</p><h2>Is Stefan's death mentioned in the originals?</h2>Fans hoped to see more crossovers from their favorite Vampire Diaries characters during The Originals' fifth and final season. Stefan died in The Vampire Diaries series finale, but there was the chance he could have shown up as a ghost or in a flashback.<h2>Who is Maya in Legacies?</h2>The Fosters alumna Bianca Santos is set for a pivotal recurring role on the upcoming second season of the CW drama series Legacies. Santos will play Maya, a sharp-tongued and flirtatious new student at Mystic Falls High, the sister of Ethan and the daughter of Sheriff Mac.<h2>Is Dorian from Legacies a vampire?</h2>Dorian Williams is a human who was originally an intern for Alaric and occult studies student. He had originally wanted to kill Stefan Salvatore for being responsible for the deaths of his father and sister years before, but chose not to. Afterwards, he became a librarian and teacher at the Salvatore Boarding School.<h2>Why can't hope and Landon's blood mix?</h2>Landon is also Malivore's son (and a phoenix/human), so it stands to reason that Hope's blood is toxic to him, too. By this logic, the rest of her would probably be pretty unsafe to Landon's health and wellbeing if they got too intimate, meaning the pair can't merge/fuse without risking his life.<h2>Is Landon Malivore in season 3?</h2>'Legacies' Season 3 finale confirms this Landon is Malivore<p>In Legacies Season 3 Episode 16, “Fate's a B—-, Isn't It,” Hope (Danielle Rose Russell) and Clark (Nick Fink) use a locator spell to find the Malivore pit.</p><h2>Why did Rafael leave Legacies?</h2>Rafael left Legacies in season 3 because he was transported to a prison world in order to spare his life.<h2>Does Lizzie have a crush on hope?</h2>Jenny Boyd (Lizzie) loves the relationship between Hope and Lizzie and the journey of accepting Hope into the family.<h2>Does Clarke like Hope?</h2>After Hope saves Clarke, the pair decide they aren't quite friends, but definitely are frenemies who are committed to bringing Malivore down together.<h2>Does Landon get his powers back?</h2>So Landon has resurrected every time he's been killed due to his Phoenix supernatural powers, all up until Legacies S2 Ep15 - When The Necromancer is controlling Raphael and he stabs him with the golden arrow (which is the one thing that can kill a phoenix).<h2>Is Lizzie Saltzman a doppelganger?</h2>There's no proof of her being a doppelganger (yet) who knows if the writers will go there, but they already did that in the vampire diaries, so probably not. A doppleganger only exists to counteract true immortals. And they stop being made after that immortal is cured and dies.<h2>How is Stefanie Salvatore a witch?</h2>Stefanie Salvatore is the heretic daughter of Damon Salvatore and Elena Gilbert, as well the younger twin sister of Stefan Salvatore. She is a witch from the Salvatore bloodline and a vampire, she gets her vampire side from both of her parents.<h2>Is Sebastian a Salvatore?</h2>Initially, as the character is being introduced, he does interact with [Lizzie] in short bursts, and as the season progresses he is much more present. Julie Plec has described Sebastian as more of a Damon Salvatore.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8isZKOZlJp6onnSmqOvmaSkv6Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
