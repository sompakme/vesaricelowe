In a trailer that looks like a sibling version to The Wire, viewers look on as Baltimore is once again the topic of a massive amount of police and political corruption, ultimately tearing its streets to shreds. Taking its plot from the real-life Gun Trace Task Force, an arm of the police department that was involved in and charged with racketeering, robbery, extortion, and overtime fraud, the series will drop jaws everywhere when it hits the network on April 25.</p><p>And, whether they meant to or not, the Jon Bernthal-led series brings up loads of memories from another HBO crime-based juggernaut, The Wire. Also set in Baltimore, The Wire ran for five seasons in the early 2000s, and took a deep dive into crooked cops, drug dealers, and those just trying to survive. But, the comparisons don’t end there. We Own This City is the brainchild of the same creators behind The Wire, George Pelecanos and David Simon. When <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">something is a hit</a>, why try to change it up? Check out Jon Bernthal in the trailer for We Own This City.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Based on the book, We Own This City: A True Story of Crime, Cops, and Corruption, penned by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Baltimore Sun</a> reporter, Justin Fenton, the series promises to stick to as much of the true story as possible without an overly dramatized version. And, with a story like this, dramatization isn’t needed. As the Jon Bernthal-led trailer points out, this isn’t even a specific-to-Baltimore event, but is something that happens everywhere around the world.</p><p>It’s a story of what unfolds when the institution is greedy for arrests for for-profit-prison systems and the people making the arrests are only looking out for themselves. At one point during the teaser, a higher-up detective makes a comment along the lines of giving the rookies the knowledge they need to be good cops and then allowing them to take the reins. But that is something that clearly just isn’t working as proven by <a href=#>tough guy</a> Jon Bernthal and the rest of the leading actors on the series.</p><p>Throughout the heartbreaking trailer, we see the team of officers, <a href=#>led</a> by Jon Bernthal, crush hopes, dreams, and bones on their quest for money and celebrity in Charm City. Seeing themselves as an untouchable group of the government, it turns into the shock of the century when the feds step up to intervene. In a matter of minutes, the entire base of corruption is flipped upside down and exposed for what they really are. It leads to not only the downfall of the police department but all those who supported them including judges and politicians.&nbsp;</p><p>And if you thought we were done with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wire</a> comparisons, we’re not. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it and the same thing stands for the actors involved in a series. We Own This City is bringing back a slew of familiar faces from the original Baltimore based crime series including Domenick Lombardozzi, Jermaine Crawford, Jamie Hector, Michael Salconi, Chris Clanton, Maria Broom, Anwan Glover, Darrell Britt-Gibson, Nathan Corbett, Susan Rome, Delaney Williams, and Trey Chaney.</p><p>New to the Baltimore streets will be Jon Bernthal, Wunmi Mosaku, Jamie Hector, and Josh Charles. Directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green, you can catch We Own This City when it lands on HBO on April 25th, at 9:00 ET/PT with streaming also available on HBO Max. Buckle up and get ready for your new true-crime-inspired infatuation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iin6N6o7HRp6uhmZxixKZ5zrClZqyYnsBur8itsGegpKK5</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
