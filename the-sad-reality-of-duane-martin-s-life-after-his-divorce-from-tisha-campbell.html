"I opened the door to Duane's dressing room and that's when I see Duane having anal sex with Will," he claimed. "There was a couch and Will was bent over the couch and Duane was standing up, killing him. Like murder. It was murder in there." He also alleged that Will tried to get him to sign an NDA but he refused. "I didn't sign the papers. I didn't talk to Will. I went to go stay with one of my friends and I just disappeared."</p><p>Reacting to the interview, Will's camp <a href=#>denied</a> the allegations and called Bilaal's story "completely fabricated" and "unequivocally false." Meanwhile, Will's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, also brushed off the claims in an interview with Power 105.1's "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>The Breakfast Club</a>."&nbsp;"It's ridiculous, right? And it's nonsense," she said. Alleging that the interview is a "shakedown," or an extortion attempt against her husband,&nbsp;Jada said that she and Will are planning to take legal action against Bilaal. "Because it's one thing to have your opinion about somebody, versus just making up salacious, malicious stories," she said. "So we 'gon roll with that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxlbX56f46smJ1lopqurbXTsmSdrZGjsm65wKuroqZdobansYyana2domLBqr%2FHmmScmZ2lr6a4y2aboq6fp7Cmew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
