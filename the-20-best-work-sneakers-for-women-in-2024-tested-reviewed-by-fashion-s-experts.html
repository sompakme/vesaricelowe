I also wore them into the office, and they blended in perfectly with the rest of my neutral wardrobe.

I live 40 minutes away from my job, with a commute that involves a train transfer and a bit of walking, so I need to be able to climb stairs, walk, and even run without worrying about breaking a heel or developing a blister. At the same time, I would never sacrifice style for function—after all, I work at a fashion magazine. These sneakers are the perfect balance, with soft leather that doesn't chafe against the backs of my ankles and cushiony soles that make me feel like I'm walking on little pillows." — Beauty Writer <a href=# data-url="When%20shopping%20for%20work%20sneakers,%20I%20prioritize%20comfort.%20I%20live%2040%20minutes%20away%20from%20my%20job,%20with%20a%20commute%20that%20involves%20a%20train%20transfer%20and%20a%20bit%20of%20walking,%20so%20I%20need%20to%20be%20able%20to%20climb%20stairs,%20walk,%20and%20even%20run%20without%20worrying%20about%20breaking%20a%20heel%20or%20developing%20a%20blister.%20At%20the%20same%20time,%20I%20would%20never%20sacrifice%20style%20for%20function%E2%80%94after%20all,%20I%20work%20at%20a%20fashion%20magazine.%20These%20sneakers%20are%20the%20perfect%20compromise,%20with%20soft%20leather%20that%20doesn't%20chafe%20against%20the%20backs%20of%20my%20angles%20and%20cushiony%20soles%20that%20make%20me%20feel%20like%20I'm%20walking%20on%20little%20pillows." data-hl-processed=none>Gabrielle Ulubay</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7MgpstLpCRmGo9U78M84Z5-1920-80.png> <a href=# data-model-name="Tory Burch Howell Court Sneakers " data-url=https://www.nordstrom.com/s/tory-burch-howell-court-sneaker-women/7248724 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/75786/1960196/23920?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Ftory-burch-howell-court-sneaker-women%2F7248724" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=nordstrom.com data-merchant-id=480139 data-merchant-url=nordstrom.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K9mBrniLxHAPx2sVuKV97e-1920-80.jpg><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Leather Work Sneakers</span></p></a><p>Tory Burch Howell Court Sneakers</p><p>There's nothing quite like a pair of crisp sneakers in the summertime. They’re reliable for any situation (including the office) and make getting dressed in the morning a little easier. With a crisp and streamlined look, this leather pair from Tory Burch is a shoe to add to your workwear rotation. You can choose from five different color trims.</p><p><strong>How Many Colors Do They Come In?: </strong>Five</p><p><strong>What’s the Size Range?: </strong>US Sizes 5-11, including half-sizes</p><p><strong>What's the Material?: </strong>Leather</p><p><strong>Marie Claire'</strong><strong>s Review: </strong>"I'm getting fatigued with It-sneakers—ones you can recognize from three New York City blocks away because they're so obviously branded. Tory Burch's Court pair is the perfect antidote: They're just as well-designed but still fly a little under the radar with their minimal, unbranded look. Whether I want to wear an oversized suit or an office-appropriate midi dress, the clean white leather goes with it all. I also love that the soles are slightly padded so that I can spend a full day on my feet without any complaints. These may be the only work shoes that I could also pack for a European vacation where 10,000-step days are on the itinerary. As much as I love my ballet flats, I can't say the same thing about those." — Senior Beauty & News Editor <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/author/halie-lesavage/>Halie LeSavage</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vjusw7Y6WHH55MQGdqBDN7-1920-80.png> <a href=# data-model-name="Adidas Samba OG Sneakers " data-url=https://adidas.com/us/samba-classic-shoes/772109.html? referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://adidas.7eer.net/c/221109/264102/4270?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk-prefix&u=https%3A%2F%2Fadidas.com%2Fus%2Fsamba-classic-shoes%2F772109.html%3F" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=adidas.com data-merchant-id=14689 data-merchant-url=adidas.com data-merchant-network=ImpactRad><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gjuUewzqh5NR9vft6a3zuc-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Sleek Work Sneakers</span></p></a><p>Adidas Samba OG Sneakers</p><p><a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/adidas-samba-sneaker-trend-2022/><u>Adidas' Sambas</u></a> animal-free sneakers aren't ending their It-sneaker reign in 2024.

"I'm partial to the navy," she says, referencing a colorway exclusive to the men's edition. With a foam insole, a '90s sensibility, and a rubber tread at the bottom for extra grip as you move through the day, they're perfect if you spend hours on your feet. If your foot is too small to fit into the men's versions, you can shop it in a few other shades, including cream, another of Pantin's favorites. Well-priced at under $80, they're the perfect affordable work-to-weekend option.</p><p><strong>How Many Colors Do They Come In?: </strong>Five for women, seven for men</p><p><strong>What's the Size Range?: </strong>US Sizes 5-11, including half-sizes</p><p><strong>What's the Material?: </strong>Nylon</p><p><strong>My Review</strong>: I tested Laurel's exact pick—the men's variation of the sneaker in navy blue—for a few reasons. I wanted to test how small the men's shoes go with a size 5 foot, and I preferred the navy blue to the color options in the women's selection. The men's size 3.5 fit and they were one of the most comfortable options on this list. At $75, they're also one of the most affordable. They were comfortable, easy to style for a sportier look, and offered my neutral outfits a touch of color— but not too much— which is a bonus. Shop for them in one of the whopping 12 shades—and you can opt for a men's shade using the size chart even if you're foot runs on the petite side.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-other-sneakers-we-love><span>Other Sneakers We Love</span></h2><a href=# data-model-name="Chloé Nama Mixed Media Platform Sneakers" data-url=https://www.saksfifthavenue.com/product/Chlo%C3%A9-Nama-Mixed-Media-Platform-Sneakers-0400015233407.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=13816&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.saksfifthavenue.com%2Fproduct%2FChlo%25C3%25A9-Nama-Mixed-Media-Platform-Sneakers-0400015233407.html" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=saksfifthavenue.com data-merchant-id=199765 data-merchant-url=saksfifthavenue.com data-merchant-network=LS><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/su48Ay9cGkyFKDWnTrGN8A-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Designer Sneakers</span></p></a><p>Chloé Nama Mixed Media Platform Sneakers</p><p><a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/chloe-nama-sneaker/>Chloé's Nama Sneakers</a> are crafted from recycled mesh.

Try a couple of sizes and consider whether the shoes run wide or narrow.</li><li><strong>Material:</strong> When shopping for work sneakers, look for elevated fabrics such as suede or leather. These materials tend to feel more formal. Avoid bright colors or in-your-face textures to make your sneakers feel more elevated.</li><li><strong>Color</strong>: When selecting sneakers, opt for a simple shape and neutral colors such as black, white, tan, or cream.
