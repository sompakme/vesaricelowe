Basically, the woman knew how to write a 90s hit.&nbsp;</p><p>So, just how much did Bey contribute to the lyrics on the group's hit 1999 album? According to Burruss, it likely wasn't much. Speaking with VICE,&nbsp;Burruss said, "I would kind of have an idea of what the melody should be; the concept and partial lyrics. ... I would already have the hook together and the melody of what the verse should be." If you're wondering what Beyoncé did write, Burruss went on to say, "I left a little open so that they could have input as well." So, maybe Bey added the "bills, bills, bills" lyrics?</p><p>After Beyoncé boasted about her songwriting skills for&nbsp;<a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>'s November 2005 issue, claiming she had "written — what? — seven, eight Number 1 songs with Destiny's Child, in a row,"&nbsp;<a href=#>Fox News</a>&nbsp;slammed the artist for taking credit for writing songs attributed "to a list of songwriters."&nbsp;Granted, that was never a secret, and is a standard industry practice, however Beyoncé's characterization of her involvement could be seen as a bit shady.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam5ga4F4e9OhnGaamZy0pr%2FTZqqcmZ6Zrq2%2FjK2mZqqfmLhusMSsq6Kmqah6pLTIpZto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
