Zaps In!</h2><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:50><span>Hey there,</span><span> fellow Fortnite fanatics in the land of Lincoln!</span><span> Got that thirst for epic live events and world-ending shenanigans?</span><span> You know,</span><span> the kind that make you question if that hot dog you just inhaled was a good idea?</span><span> Well,</span><span> buckle up,</span><span> buttercup,</span><span> because this guide is here to ensure you don't miss the next Fortnite apocalypse while you're busy shuckin' corn!</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=5:1-5:52>But First, A Word From Our Sponsors (Not Really)</h3><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:34><span>Before we dive into the timey-wimey stuff,</span><span> let's address the elephant in the room (or should we say,</span><span> the giant mech in the sky?</span><span>).</span><span> There isn't currently any official news about a Fortnite live event on the horizon.</span><span> Epic Games likes to keep us on our toes,</span><span> those sneaky devils.</span><span> However,</span><span> fear not,</span><span> fellow Flosser!</span><span> This guide will be your trusty battle bus when the next live event rolls around,</span><span> Illinois time!</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=9:1-9:61>So, How Do We Know When the Next Live Event Is Happening?</h3><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:321><span>Here's the thing,</span><span> chief:</span><span> Epic tends to be tight-lipped about these events until the very last minute.</span><span> Sometimes,</span><span> they'll drop hints in-game or on social media,</span><span> but other times,</span><span> it's a mad scramble to log in before the party starts.</span><span> That's why staying frosty (and by frosty,</span><span> we mean informed) is key!</span><span> Here's your arsenal:</span></p><ul data-sourcepos=13:1-16:0><li data-sourcepos=13:1-13:161><strong>Follow Fortnite on Social Media:</strong><span> Twitter,</span><span> Instagram,</span><span> the whole shebang.</span><span> They might just drop a cryptic tweet that sends the Fortnite fandom into a frenzy.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=14:1-14:251><strong>Check Fortnite Leaks (With a Grain of Salt):</strong><span> There are plenty of Fortnite leak channels and websites out there,</span><span> but be warned:</span><span> some leaks are faker than a politician's smile.</span><span> Take everything with a grain of salt until Epic themselves confirm it.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=15:1-16:0><strong>Listen to the Buzz:</strong><span> The Fortnite community is a hivemind,</span><span> my friend.</span><span> If everyone's suddenly talking about a live event,</span><span> there's probably a fire (or a Zero Point explosion) brewing.</span></li></ul><h3 data-sourcepos=17:1-17:87>Okay, Okay, But How Do I Know the Time in Illinois When the Event Actually Happens?</h3><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:221><span>Now we're talkin'!</span><span> Since Fortnite live events are usually a global affair,</span><span> they typically happen at the same time for everyone.</span><span> But fear not,</span><span> because we've got the handy-dandy time conversion magic for you Illinois folks:</span></p><ul data-sourcepos=21:1-23:0><li data-sourcepos=21:1-21:110><strong>Epic announces the event time in Eastern Time (ET):</strong><span> That's the time zone for New York City and the gang.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=22:1-23:0><strong>Illinois is in Central Time (CT):</strong><span> Which means you gotta </span><strong>subtract one hour</strong><span> from the announced ET time to get your Illinois Fortnite party time.</span></li></ul><p data-sourcepos=24:1-24:135><strong>For example:</strong><span> If Epic announces a live event for 8 PM ET,</span><span> then giddy up,</span><span> Illinois Flossers,</span><span> because the party starts at </span><strong>7 PM CT!</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=26:1-26:116><strong>Underline this in permanent marker:</strong><span> Don't be caught grillin' when the world is about to end (again) in Fortnite!</span></p><h2

sure you have a stable internet connection (unless you enjoy watching the event buffer like a dying toaster).</span></li><li data-sourcepos=34:1-35:0><span>Warn your family you might be screaming into

vary,</span><span> but typically they're around 10-15 minutes long.</span><span> Enough time for some epic action and maybe a new reality for our favorite characters (or a giant robot taking a dump on the map,</span><span> who knows with Epic?</span><span>).</span></p><p data-sourcepos=44:1-44:34><strong>What if I miss the live event?</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=46:1-46:144><span>Don't
