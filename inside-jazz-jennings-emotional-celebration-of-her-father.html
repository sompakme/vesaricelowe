She called him an "incredible man" and acknowledged, "There are not many fathers out there who would allow their child to transition in a time when transgender youth were practically unheard of." Jazz also credited her father Greg with giving her "a voice and the freedom to be my true self." The "I Am Jazz" star added she loved him "so much" and knew she would "always cherish our special connection."</p><p>This was hardly the first time Jazz highlighted her love for Greg. A 2016 Father's Day <a href=#>Instagram</a> post featured a photo of Greg holding baby Jazz and she noted, "You have been there for me since the very beginning." In a Father's Day <a href=#>Facebook</a> post in 2018, Jazz wrote he was "the greatest man I have ever met: so loyal, honest, kind, thoughtful, and caring." She noted he always provided "a listening ear whenever I needed someone to hear my deepest and most authentic emotions," and wrote his "unconditional love and support" had forever changed her life.&nbsp;</p><p>In the early days of publicly talking about Jazz's <a href=#>transgender</a> story, Greg admitted, per <a href=#>ABC News</a>, "Every day I'm afraid that I might get a call that something happened."&nbsp;Despite those worries, "what we've tried to do for Jazz is give her as much self-esteem as we can." Judging by Jazz's social media posts honoring her dad, his support has not gone unnoticed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb3BgbIV2e8inqqKclWK3osbZZqGepp6eu6i%2FjJ6kqKyZpLuiuIycnKWdkqeutbXOp2Sonl2dsrN5xZqroZ2iZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
