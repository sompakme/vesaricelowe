She does have one complaint, however. Not being able to drink alcohol has proved tiresome, especially given all the hospitality at red carpet affairs. "I can't drink. I'm up for an Oscar and I can't drink at the Oscars," she lamented. "I went to the doctor - you have to get lots of doctor check ups when your pregnant - and she asked if I had any questions. And I said 'Yes! When can I drink!? Please!

The bride wore a tulle Rodarte dress for her big day. The actress was spotted recycling her Rodarte number months later.
