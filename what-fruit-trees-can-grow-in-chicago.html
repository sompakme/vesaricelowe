Apple? A Guide to Growing Your Own Fruit in the Windy City</h2><span></span><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:50><span>So,</span><span> you're tired of those store-bought apples that look like they were polished with a bowling ball?</span><span> You yearn for the thrill of biting into a juicy peach you nurtured from a tiny sprout (and maybe even bragged about to your neighbors)?</span><span> Well,</span><span> my friend,</span><span> fret no more!</span><span> You can cultivate your own backyard orchard oasis right here in the fantastically fierce city of Chicago.</span><span> But before you grab your shovel and head to the nearest nursery with a shopping cart full of hope,</span><span> let's talk about what fruits actually stand a fighting chance in our fair city's climate that's more bipolar than your ex.</span></p><span></span><h3 data-sourcepos=5:1-5:61><strong>Chicago's Champs: Trees That Can Take the Windy City</strong></h3><span></span><ul data-sourcepos=7:1-7:272><span></span><li data-sourcepos=7:1-7:272><span></span><p data-sourcepos=7:3-7:566><strong>Apples, Apples, and More Apples:</strong><span> Let's face it,</span><span> Chicago and apples go together like deep dish pizza and heartburn (but hey,</span><span> it's worth it!</span><span>).</span><span> There are tons of </span><strong>disease-resistant</strong><span> apple varieties that'll thrive in our climate,</span><span> like the ever-popular Honeycrisp,</span><span> the delightfully tart Granny Smith,</span><span> or the insanely sweet Pink Lady (because who doesn't love a little pink fruit in their life?</span><span>).</span><span> </span><strong>Bonus points</strong><span> if you choose dwarf or semi-dwarf varieties – perfect for smaller yards or those who just don't want to spend their days climbing a tree to harvest.</span></p><span></span></li><span></span><li data-sourcepos=9:1-10:0><span></span><p data-sourcepos=9:3-9:355><strong>Pear-fect for You:</strong><span> Pears are another fantastic option for Chicago.</span><span> They're just as </span><strong>cold-hardy</strong><span> as apples and come in a delightful variety,</span><span> from the classic Bartlett to the juicy Asian pears.</span><span> Just be warned,</span><span> some pear trees need a buddy (another pear tree variety) to produce fruit,</span><span> so do your research before you plant that lonely pear sapling.</span></p><span></span></li><span></span><li data-sourcepos=11:1-11:341><span></span><p data-sourcepos=11:3-11:341><strong>Cherry on Top:</strong><span> Sour cherry trees are a great choice for Chicago.</span><span> They can handle the cold and their fruit is perfect for pies,</span><span> jams,</span><span> or just some good old-fashioned cherry fights in the backyard (IYKYK).</span><span> Sweet cherry trees are a bit more iffy – they're less cold-tolerant and prone to diseases.</span><span> But hey,</span><span> if you're feeling adventurous,</span><span> give it a shot!</span></p><span></span></li><span></span></ul><span></span><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:242><strong>Wait, There's More!</strong><span> This isn't an exhaustive list,</span><span> folks!</span><span> You can also try your luck with </span><strong>nectarines</strong><span> (though they require more maintenance),</span><span> </span><strong>plums</strong><span> (perfect for jam-making!</span><span>),</span><span> and even </span><strong>bushes</strong><span> like raspberries and blueberries.</span></p><span></span><h3 data-sourcepos=15:1-15:44><strong>So You Want to Be a Fruit Whisperer?</strong></h3><span></span><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:75><span>Here are a few things to keep in mind before you start planting like crazy:</span></p><span></span><ul data-sourcepos=19:1-22:0><span></span><li data-sourcepos=19:1-19:154><strong>Sunshine is Key:</strong><span> Most fruit trees need at least </span><strong>6-8 hours of sunlight</strong><span> a day.</span><span> So,</span><span> ditch the shade and pick a spot that gets plenty of sun rays.</span></li><span></span><li data-sourcepos=20:1-20:214><strong>Size Matters:</strong><span> Consider how big your tree will get at maturity.</span><span> Don't plant a giant apple tree right next to your house unless you want to spend your days dodging falling fruit (and possibly angry neighbors).</span></li><span></span><li data-sourcepos=21:1-22:0><strong>Winter Woes:</strong><span> Chicago winters can be brutal.</span><span> Choose </span><strong>cold-hardy</strong><span> varieties that can withstand the temperature dips.</span></li><span></span></ul><span></span><p data-sourcepos=23:1-23:56><strong>Remember:</strong><span> Taking care of your fruit trees isn't just about watering them and hoping for the best.</span><span> There's pruning,</span><span> pest control,</span><span> and maybe even a little talking-sweetly-to-them involved (though that last one is entirely optional).</span></p><span></span><p data-sourcepos=25:1-25:278><strong>With a little planning and some elbow grease, you can be harvesting your own delicious homegrown fruit right here in Chicago. So, what are you waiting for? Get planting and get ready to become the envy of the neighborhood (or at least the person with the coolest backyard).</strong></p><span></span>5710240509224922019<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maW1frLWiwIyfqa6hpGLBs7HErGScmZ5itLO71magp2WTnbakrcaoZaGsnaE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
