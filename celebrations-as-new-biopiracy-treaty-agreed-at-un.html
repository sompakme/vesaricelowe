The new treaty, agreed by more than 190 nations, aims to combat so-called biopiracy by making applicants for patents disclose the origins of such materials used in a new invention.
Genetic resources -- such as those found in medicinal plants, agricultural crops and animal breeds -- are increasingly used by companies in everything from cosmetics to seeds, medicines, biotechnology and food supplements."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

class=align-left>The goal is to combat biopiracy by ensuring that an invention is genuinely new, and that the countries and local communities concerned agree with the use of their genetic resources,

of countries that adopt the agreement</p><p class=align-left>Some developing countries wanted to be able to revoke patents easily, while wealthy countries argued that stiff penalties would hamper innovation.</p><p class=align-left>"We commend the outcome achieved, which strikes a fine balance between fostering innovation and enhancing transparency in the patent system," the Netherlands said on behalf of a group of mostly Western countries.</p><p class=align-left>The treaty will enter into force once 15 countries have ratified it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img
