In May, it was revealed that The Durrells actor Josh had been lined up to play a young Prince Charles. He tweeted at the time: "I am thrilled to be joining The Firm for the next instalment of The Crown. Seasons three and four will follow some of the most turbulent events in the Prince of Wales' life and our national story and I'm excited to be bringing to life the man in the midst of it all."</p><p id=enqIWHAQgZGk data-wc=1><strong>MORE: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>From Helen Mirren to Claire Foy - actresses who have portrayed the Queen</a></p><p id=eEwrHDcU2U5x data-wc=74>Season three of The Crown is slated for an early 2019 release, although the exact date has yet to be confirmed.
