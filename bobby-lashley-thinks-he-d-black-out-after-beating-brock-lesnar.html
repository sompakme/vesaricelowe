For a long time now Lashley has made it clear he wants to face off against Brock Lesnar in any way possible. It seems Lashley has an interesting thought about his upcoming match.</p><p>Even fans themselves have wanted nothing more than for the two behemoths to finally square off inside the squared circle. Lashley made it clear on numerous occasions he wants to face the Beast.</p><p>At the WWE Day 1 pay-per-view, Brock Lesnar won the WWE Championship after defeating Big E, Seth Rollins, Kevin Owens, and Bobby Lashley. It seems he has now tied with two WWE legends for a huge record.</p><p>Bobby Lashley then became the #1 contender for Brock Lesnar’s title a couple of weeks ago. The two would have confrontations on Monday Night RAW that set up their feud properly.</p><p>While speaking with the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post</a>, Bobby Lashley was asked about what it would mean for him to beat Lesnar. Lashley stated that he thinks he would black out if Lashley defeats Lesnar.</p><p>“I could tell you all kinds of words, I could think of all kinds of analogies but I don’t think anything is going to be able to express how I feel or I don’t know how I’m gonna feel. I think I’ll probably black out right after I put him out. He’ll probably fall out. Make him tap, I’ll probably fall out too. You wouldn’t know who the champion was. Just throw the title down, somebody won it,</p><p>Brock Lesnar is set to defend his WWE Championship against Bobby Lashley at the WWE Royal Rumble pay-per-view on January 29th this year. We will have to wait and see who will end up winning the match.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX9ze49qZmtwX5e8o67YZqOaq5ihsrp506Ggp6OjYrWmsIybo5qbm2K8tsCMmp2tnaJir6at06KloGWSp7ykt4ylnKymkad8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
