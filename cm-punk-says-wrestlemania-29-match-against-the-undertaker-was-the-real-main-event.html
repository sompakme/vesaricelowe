CM Punk squared off against The Deadman at WrestleMania 29 in 2013 as he was hell-bent on breaking the Streak. It seems his final WrestleMania match stands out as a special one for Punk."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It seems his final WrestleMania match stands out as a special one for Punk.</p><p>While speaking to <a href=#>Robbie Fox on My Mom’s Basement</a>, CM Punk talked about his WrestleMania match against The Undertaker. Punk stated that no one could follow up on his performance at WrestleMania 29 and declared that it was the real main event of the pay-per-view.</p><p>“Given all the circumstances leading up to it and everything that happened after it, that’s the most defining punk rock moment of my entire career. I didn’t care about anything. I was a man possessed and I simultaneously didn’t give a fuck and cared way too much at the same time. I went out there and fucking absolutely destroyed it. They couldn’t follow me, no matter what they said. People, to this day, will be like, ‘You never main evented WrestleMania.’ Yes, I did. It was that one. You should’ve packed it up and fucking went home after that.”</p><p>The Undertaker would go on to defeat CM Punk in the match and it was his final match before the Streak ended at WrestleMania 30 at the hands of Brock Lesnar.</p><p>CM Punk had also recently talked<a href=#> about possibly facing Kenny Omega</a> if he ever makes an in-ring return. We will have to see if Punk ever makes a pro wrestling comeback somewhere down the line.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-dailymotion wp-block-embed-dailymotion wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>h/t to Fightful for the quotes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX9ye49tZmpsX5i6brzUp6Jmq5GuwG7D0Z6qraSVoq6vtcBmaXJlnZbBpLSMmp6aoZ6owW7Ax55krqaUmr%2B1rcqeqWavkah6tbTEZqmemZxiuqK1zWacr52eqXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
