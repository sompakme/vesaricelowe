Unfortunately, one awkward onstage moment has been overshadowing many of the others. While the cast of The White Lotus was accepting their prize for Best Ensemble, Aubrey Plaza was reportedly informed by a costar that her "boob [was] hanging out." Of course, the crowd couldn't see the starlet's full chest. Still, her Michael Kors gown did show off a bit of underboob all throughout the evening.</p><p>At this time it remains unclear exactly what was said to Plaza during the speech. Whatever it was, the angry expression on her face made it evident she wasn't pleased. Cameras also caught her muttering obscenities like "Shit's f*cked" and "Jesus Christ," causing a definite stir online as viewers at home tried to piece together the drama unfolding. On Monday (February 27), a source close to the 38-year-old actress was able to <a href=# rel>provide some context</a>.</p><span><h2 id=h-aubrey-s-sag-awards-slip-up>Aubrey's SAG Awards Slip-Up</h2></span><p>"[Her anger] was a direct result of her almost being elbowed in her face," they previously told DailyMail. The near-injury took place as the many performers were shuffling around the stage. Many female stars were notably being pushed to the back of the group as older male actors like Michael Imperioli and F. Murray Abraham addressed the crowd. She was <a href=# rel>obviously upset</a> on Sunday evening. Thankfully, Plaza has since shared a photo dump on Instagram celebrating the HBO series' big win.</p><p>In the caption, she wrote, "Best cast ever! I love these people and am so proud of this show. Thank you @sagawards." Throughout various photos we see her celebrating, trophy in hand, on the red carpet with The White Lotus' other stars. She also found time to pose for pictures with Wednesday starlet Jenna Ortega, as well as Parks & Recreation costar, Amy Poehler.</p><span><h2>Stylist Jessica Paster Speaks Out</h2></span><p>Aubrey Plaza at the 29th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards held at the Fairmont Century Plaza on February 26, 2023, in Los Angeles, California.

As hateful comments have come pouring in, specifically about the garment's fit, she's clapped back with her side of the story. "The straps could be better adjusted. I love the colour, and hair and makeup look amazing," one Instagram user wrote following the SAG Awards.</p><p>"Did seven fittings... For real... I wanted underboob," Paster dished in the replies, making it known she and her client were attempting to turn heads with the gown's centre cutout.
