As your dog understands it, you're home more than ever now, you're always down for a cathartic snuggle, and when you say the magic words to your computer—"Thanks, everyone!"—it almost always means Walk Time. As for you, you've never been more grateful for the unconditional support and love you get from your canine best bud. In return, your dog deserves nothing less than one of the best dog gifts.</p><p>Can dogs understand concepts like "holidays" or "birthday" or even "just because I missed you"? No, probably not. Do they deserve a gift anyway? Of course they do. Maybe it's the anniversary of the day you got them, maybe it's just a random Tuesday—look, I don't care, and your dog doesn't, either. All they care about is that the shiny new thing you put in front of them is something they'll love, and those are the kind of dog toys (and gadgets, and apparel) you'll find on this list. Some of these dog gifts are designed to spark joy in dogs, and others will appeal to their owners. Some of the gifts on this list do both.</p><p>As for me and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/captainhollander/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>my dog, Captain,</a> we've painstakingly taken the time to test-drive the toys and other products on this list. (Yes, my job is very hard; yes, Captain is very spoiled.) So please allow Captain and I to present: The best gifts for dogs and the people who adore them, from personalized collars, sweaters, and portraits to plush toys, treat makers, and ingenious gadgets that they won't be able to get enough of. A bonus: Every one is&nbsp;great&nbsp;for Instagram.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-best-dog-toys><span>Best Dog Toys</span></h2><p>I'm not an expert on many things, but I've lived with and loved—well, my dogs have loved—upwards of 100 dog toys, from plush toys to puzzle toys gifted by friends and relatives and endless "just because" toys. I've also had two dogs to try out the toys for me: Captain, who is so attached to his toys that we have to take several on every vacation, and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/skipperthehound/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Skipper</a>, who loved nothing more than destroying toys for hours and proudly showing guests their remains.

But their Bolt Bite, billed as "the ultimate chew toy for dogs," deserves some of the spotlight, too: You can put little treats into each end, or use it as part of a game of fetch, and the middle has a reinforced rubber center so your dog will struggle to tear it apart. (Worth noting, though, that it can be torn apart—it'll just take longer than a typical toy.) Bonus: It's BPA-free and dishwasher-friendly.

(I'm not proud. Actually, I'm a little proud.) A hot tip: For personalized dog gifts, order them well in advance—I'm talking 3 to 4 months—and if you're being quoted significantly less time than that, question its quality. Great personalized dog gifts, like the ones on this list, take time to create, especially around the holidays.</p><a href=# data-model-name="West & Willow Custom Pet Portrait Phone Case" data-url=https://westandwillow.com/products/custom-pet-portrait-phone-cases referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j8eEiKJ9WTTmNJBDH8rMo5-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Dog Phone Case</span></p></a><p>West & Willow Custom Pet Portrait Phone Case</p><p>Custom pet portraits can run expensive—I've learned this, well, the expensive way—but <a href=# data-url=https://westandwillow.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>West & Willow</a> sells a whole line of chic merchandise complete with custom-drawn portraits of your pet, and it's all relatively affordable (between $50-$100).

Perfect for kids and grown-ups alike, you can spend hours trying to find your dog in the middle of the beautifully illustrated landscapes.
