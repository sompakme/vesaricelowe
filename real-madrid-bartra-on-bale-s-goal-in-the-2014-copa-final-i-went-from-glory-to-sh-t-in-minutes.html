With Gareth Bale's goal in the 2014 Copa del Rey final giving Real Madrid a 2-1 victory over rivals Barcelona, Marc Bartra has revealed his pain at losing the trophy. Angel di Maria had given Real Madrid an early lead before Bartra equalised, but Bale burned the Barcelona defender for speed 85 minutes in and poked the ball past Jose Pinto, exactly six years ago on April 16, 2014."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"But I'm not going to say anything as it isn't pleasant and is very tiring.</p><p>"The joke is a good one and it has gone around many times. You have characteristics and Gareth others, it's a final and a moment right at the end."</p><p>Bartra though didn't shy away from addressing the incident, and he admitted was one of the hardest he has had to take.</p><p>"For me it was hard as hell," <strong>Bartra </strong>replied. "I was a youngster who had come from the bottom to play against Real Madrid for the first time.</p><p>"On top of that I scored a goal against <strong>Casillas</strong>, and then went from glory to sh*t in a matter of minutes. It was very hard to take.</p><p>"I don't mind talking about it as I haven't before, and one thing I remember is after that game you [Casillas] came and gave me encouragement.</p><p>"I realised that <strong>Casillas </strong>was a good person. With everything you'd won, you came and hugged a youngster and gave me strength."</p><p><strong>Bale</strong>'s goal which came down the left flank was fondly remembered by <strong>Casillas</strong>, with <strong>Bartra </strong>unable to stop the flying Welshman.</p><p>"You learn from mistakes, but I don't see that incident as a mistake," <strong>Casillas </strong>said. "It is more great play on Gareth's part.</p><p>"Any other player would have given up on that ball or would have thrown himself to the ground and asked for a foul in order to stop him running."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jp%2BmqKySlrmte9GemKVlnZaxs7XDaGlpamBkfXV7kG9mbp1pba91gcGcmG1vZGaycoOScZltbmOZe6nAzKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
