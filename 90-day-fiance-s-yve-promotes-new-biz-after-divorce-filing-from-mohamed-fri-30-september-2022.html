Yve filed for divorce from Mohamed on September 22, 2022 after Mohamed admitted he had been texting other women. After allowing Yve to see his phone, which included flirty text exchanges, he said he wanted to make the situation “right” by telling the other unidentified women he could not talk to them any more.</p><p>Mohamed said: “I texted these women and told them, ‘I am a married man, please stop texting me.'” He added:</p><p>I know I did wrong. I told the same story to my wife and promised her that will never happen again. I do love Yve, and she doesn’t deserve that.</p><p>A police report obtained by ET states Yve was charged with assault and battery against a household member. However, Yve’s reps have called all allegations “false” and accused Mohamed of making them up.</p><p><strong>Reality Titbit has contacted both Yve and Mohamed for comment.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Mohamed 90 Day Fiancé (@mo_official90)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-yve-promotes-new-clothing-business>Yve promotes new clothing business</h2><p>Since Yve filed for divorce, Mohamed has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">remained </a>off social media.
