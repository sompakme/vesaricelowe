It is derived from the&nbsp;Stevia rebaudiana&nbsp;plant, a member of the Asteraceae family. It has a mild, sweet taste similar to sugar but not as intense. It can be used as a sugar substitute in baking, cooking, and beverages. It has been used for centuries in South America as a sweetener and medicinal herb.</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>In terms of taste, pure stevia is sweeter than sugar but has a slightly bitter aftertaste. It is also not as soluble as sugar, so it dissolves slowly. For this reason, it is best used in recipes that are not too sweet and in drinks and beverages. Some people prefer to use stevia in combination with other sweeteners, such as agave nectar or honey.</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>This article will explore how stevia may impact blood sugar levels and the health benefits of including this sugar alternative in your diet.&nbsp;</p><p>Get more information about weight loss, glucose monitors, and living a healthier life</p><p>Thank you!

Several studies have found that kaempferol can help reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer by 23%.³</p><h3 class=food-h3>May Lower Blood Pressure</h3><p>Stevia extract contains glucosides that have been found to dilate blood vessels, increase sodium excretion, and increase urine output.&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>A 2003 study found that stevia could possibly help lower blood pressure because the stevia plant may have cardiotonic actions.⁴ Cardiotonic actions work to normalize blood pressure and regulate the human body’s heartbeat. However, more recent studies have counteracted these findings, so further research is needed.</p><h3 class=food-h3>May Help Manage Cholesterol</h3><p>According to a 2009 study, stevia leaf powder could possibly help manage cholesterol. In this study, individuals consumed 20 milliliters of stevia extract daily for one month. The researchers found that stevia lowered total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides with no negative side effects while increasing HDL cholesterol levels.⁵</p><h3 class="food-h3 w-dyn-bind-empty"></h3><h2 class=food-h2>Is Stevia Good for Weight Loss?</h2><p>The intake of additional sugar in food products has been shown to contribute an average of 16% of the total calories in Americans' diets, which has been linked to weight gain.⁹ Stevia contains no sugar and no calories as opposed to table sugar which contains approximately 45 calories per tablespoon. In a study with 31 adult participants, those who ate a 290-calorie snack made with stevia ate the same amount of food at the next meal as those who ate a 500-calorie snack made with sugar.⁷ They also reported similar fullness levels, which shows that the group consuming stevia has an overall lower caloric intake while feeling the same satiety.⁷&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>While artificial sweeteners and sugar substitutes are safe to include in your diet, your goal should be to lower your overall sugar intake. Continue to work on decreasing your intake of processed foods and sweetened products as much as possible. Pick whole options and fresh fruits whenever possible, and increase the flavor appeal of your meals using spices and herbs instead of sweeteners!</p><h2 class=food-h2>Is Stevia Safe for People Living with Diabetes?</h2><p>Research has shown that stevia sweeteners do not contain calories or carbohydrates and have no effect on blood glucose levels or insulin response.⁷&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows people living with diabetes to enjoy different foods made with stevia without being concerned about their safety.</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>A review of five randomized controlled trials compared the effects of stevia on metabolic outcomes.⁸ The researchers found that stevia showed minimal to no impacts on blood glucose, insulin levels, blood pressure, and body weight.&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>In one of the above trials, individuals living with&nbsp;<a href=#>type 2 diabetes</a>&nbsp;reported that stevia caused significant reductions in their blood glucose and glucagon responses after a meal.⁸</p><p>Get more information about weight loss, glucose monitors, and living a healthier life</p><p>Thank you!

A 2016 study found that stevia increases progesterone production in sperm, leading to questions about its role as an endocrine disruptor.⁶ For those on prescription medications or with chronic health conditions, you should consult with a healthcare professional before adding stevia to your diet.</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>In regards to allergies, the stevia plant is in the Asteraceae family, which also contains ragweed, goldenrod, and other allergen-producing plants. If you have allergies to these types of plants, it is recommended that you avoid stevia.&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>Symptoms of a stevia allergy include itchiness of the mouth, lips, or throat, swelling, and redness. In severe cases, allergic reactions can cause hives, difficulty breathing, and anaphylaxis.
