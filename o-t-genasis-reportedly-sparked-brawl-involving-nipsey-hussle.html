According to the footage, O.T. Genasis confronted the man prior to the brawl. Genasis&nbsp;is seen getting into a fight inside of the club on Sunday right before Nipsey Hussle and Lauren London arrived. The "Bae" rapper throws a punch at the&nbsp;same guy who swung on Nipsey Hussle later in the evening.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">There's a chance the man confused O.T.

Both rappers are seen wearing similar plaid shirts.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">By the end of the night, things calmed down a bit after people dispersed once police showed up.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Aside from his brawl on Sunday night at Nightingale nightclub, Nipsey Hussle has much more positive things to focus on. The rapper's official studio debut,&nbsp;Victory Lap&nbsp;earned Nipsey Hussle his first Grammy nomination.
