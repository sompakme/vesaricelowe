The album,&nbsp;</span><span>Don’t Be Cruel,</span><span>&nbsp;had the best-selling albums of 1988 – 7million copies in about six months – and would attract another 5million in sales next year.&nbsp;This album remains Bobby Brown’s best album to date.&nbsp;Building on this success,</span><span>On Our Own</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Policeman</span><span>&nbsp;in 1990 and 1992 respectively.</span></p><p><span>As his career as a solo artist began, so did his sex appeal, as he was often compared to pop idol Michael Jackson&nbsp;</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Even though he was the most popular singer of the 1980s and 1990s, he too often got caught up in the law due to drug, alcohol, driving under the influence ( DUI) and many other vices that discouraged his music.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family – Parents</span></strong></h2><p><span>As stated earlier, there is controversy regarding the actual number of siblings that Bobby Brown has.&nbsp;There are only two known siblings – Leolah Brown and Tommy Brown – but some authority websites have reported more.&nbsp;Some claim Bobby’s parents gave birth to eight children, others say they were six years old, but no other names were given.&nbsp;Her parents, both late, are Herbert James Brown, a construction worker, and Carole Elizabeth Williams, a substitute teacher.</span></p><p><span>While her mother died in 2011, her father spent another year before joining his afterlife wife in January 2012. He had battled cancer and lost his life in the process.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wife, daughter, children, son</span></strong></h2><p><span>As her career blossomed, Bobby Brown approached the most popular female musical talent at the time and promptly took her to the altar on July 18, 1992 at her New Jersey estate.&nbsp;The music star’s name was Whitney Houston, and their wedding was a high-powered celebrity wedding.</span></p><p><span>They met at the Soul Train Music Awards in 1989 and she invited him to her 26th birthday party and that’s how they hit it off.&nbsp;However, even though the marriage was a first class affair, the marriage was far from first class – it was a problem from the start.&nbsp;They were stories of domestic violence, infidelity, substance abuse and substance abuse, including cocaine.&nbsp;Houston would later claim that Bobby Brown introduced her to cocaine, a claim that was not hard to believe, although Bobby himself denied it.</span></p><p><span>Needless to say, the turmoil in dirty marriage affects his career and he can only release one album in 15 years of marriage to Whitney Houston.&nbsp;-The album titled Forever (1997) was considered a commercial wreck.&nbsp;The marriage, however, gave birth to a daughter – Bobbi Kristina Brown – before the union broke up in 2006. Kristina was born on March 4, 1993.</span></p><p><span>Spending his marriage in Houston, he started dating Alicia Etheredge who he married in June 2012 and has remained with her to this day.&nbsp;They have three children together and are Cassius Brown (a son born May 31, 2009, three years before their marriage), Bodhi Jameson Rein Brown (a daughter born July 9, 2015) and Hendrix Estelle Sheba Brown (another daughter)., born July 21, 2016).</span></p><p><span>However, Bobby Brown fathered seven (not four) children from his kidneys.&nbsp;He had his first son, Landon Brown, as a teenager at the age of 17 in 1986, from his relationship with Melika Williams.&nbsp;When he ended his affair with Williams, he dated Kim Ward and she gave birth to two children to him – a daughter, La’Princia Brown, in 1989, and a son, Robert Barisford Brown, Jr., in 1992. He was already breaking up with Ward 1991, when she was found to be with his child.</span></p><p><span>Bobbi Kristina Brown, her only child with WhitneyHouston, is the only one not alive today.&nbsp;On January 31, 2015, she was found motionless in a bathtub at her home.&nbsp;She was placed in an induced coma and six months later died on July 26, 2015 at the age of 22.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Bobby Brown’s&nbsp;</span><span>Body Info – Height, Weight</span></strong></h2><p><strong><span>Height:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;178 cm (5 ft 10 in)</span></p><p><strong><span>Weight:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;90 kg (198 lbs)</span></p><p><strong><span>Bodybuilding:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Athletic</span></p><p><strong><span>Hair Color:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Black</span></p><p><strong><span>Eye color:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Dark brown</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGian5evunnBq6awpl2XtrB5z5qpnqakqHq4tcWeZKynnmKxosHGoaueql2brq61y7JkoZ2ZnLW1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
