However, her father Michael Middleton actually does have high society ties. As&nbsp;<a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> revealed, Michael is the grandson of Olive Lupton. Lupton was a wealthy socialite who moved in upper crust circles. Sure enough, last year, <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> published pictures of Lupton and her family alongside none other than Princess Mary, all of them attending a garden party in the 1920s. Per <a href=#>Town & Country</a>, the princess was the younger sister of King George VI, making her <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II's</a> aunt.&nbsp;</p><p>As Vanity Fair noted, Lupton received a sizeable inheritance from her father — we're talking more than $10 million, split between her and her sister — some of which was held in trust funds for Michael. As for where Luptons' father's wealth came from, <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>&nbsp;reported he was the son of Frank Lupton, who transformed the centuries-old family wool business into an exceptionally successful endeavor. In light of those trust funds, Michael enjoyed a rather refined upbringing. Like his children, he attended an elite school, Clifton College (via <a href=#>Mirror</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Family inheritance aside, Michael Middleton went on to have an impressive career of his own as a flight dispatcher for British Airways. However, by far his biggest professional achievement is the company he owns with his wife.
