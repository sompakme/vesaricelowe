That might be more due to Liam Galagher simply having a louder personality, coupled with his belief that rock and roll is about the attitude. For one thing, Noel has had his bursts, famously wishing (as <a href=#>Celebretainment</a> reported) that Damon Albarn would catch AIDs and die and stating in an interview that he knew "[ how to] read him and ... play him like a slightly disused arcade game ... I can make him make decisions that he thinks are his but really they're mine. Without fighting. It's an art I've learned." It's safe to assume Noel can be just as toxic, but in ways subtler than Liam.</p><p>The most telling moment for the two however is a 1994 interview posted on YouTube titled "Wibbling Rivalry" (warning: most assuredly NSFW) that covered their reactions to Liam's deportation from the Netherlands for inciting a drunken fight. Noel complains that Liam thinks it's rock-and-roll to get thrown off a ferry instead of playing the music, and Liam complains about how rock-and-roll is about being yourself, like the Sex Pistols, whom Liam loves as the best band ever, and Noel disparages for only having made one album. Perhaps the real feud centers on conflicting visions, but, as Noel admitted to <a href=#>Sky TV in 2019</a>, neither Gallagher brother would have gotten anywhere without the other.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bk3FqbWlfrLW6ec2onKVlkaOxbrjImqRmn5GhuaKzx56pZp6ipLpuu8CsoKxlmqrAtXnCqKylnJ6peqix02aYpaeenHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
