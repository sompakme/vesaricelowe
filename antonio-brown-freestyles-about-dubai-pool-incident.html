He also called out the NFL for forcing concussed players to show up on the field anyway.</p><p>Cindy Ord/Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"My name more precious to be diamonds n gold," he wrote. "Y y'all keep playing with my character, they tried to bury me forgot I was a seed... It’s crazy to me that even after I retire there is disinformation coming out about me. Ironically, during a time when the NFL is getting heat for allowing players to play when they’re clearly concussed. They’ve been using black men as guinea pigs."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Every chance they get to sway the heat off themselves they use me," he continued. "In the video you can clearly see she runs off with my swim trunks. If roles were reversed the headlines would read 'AB having a wild night with nude female.' Yet when it’s me it automatically becomes a hate crime."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">AB also had a cheeky tweet for the NFL concerning the incident. "I’m telling every team that needs some offense to pick up AB bc he’s shown that he still has the ability to expose a D," he wrote.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite these harbored feelings of resentment, the ex-Buccaneer is clearly not above having some fun with the situation. In the recently published freestyle, he raps "Ooh, I'm tryna get turnt up, but they tryna turn me down, I had that b***h in the pool, she took my jaw and then she turned me down, I'm taking her out and I'm showing off, I'm showing how good it is too, whoo!"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Readers are probably aware of the outraged response to Brown's actions, calling it out as ignorant behavior or grounds for harassment. Regardless of the public backlash, it seems he will continue to take advantage of the stir it's caused. Considering <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he released a new album this year,</a> so stay tuned to HotNewHipHop to see if he actually puts some Dubai pool bars on wax one day.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkaIR2gpRmmKesn6O2sHnBq6awpl2bv6ax0q2wpZ2jYq6ju9StZJ2tkpa2brzOqKNmoZ6YtqWxza0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
