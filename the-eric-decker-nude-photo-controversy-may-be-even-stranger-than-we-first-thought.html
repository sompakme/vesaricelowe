If you're going to use your kids for clout .... Maybe don't have kids?" one person <a href=#>wrote</a> under Decker's follow-up post to the fiasco. They weren't alone in thinking the post may have been a ploy for headlines. "Eric Decker and his wife are notoriously desperate for attention," someone <a href=#>tweeted</a>. "Their antics to get press are well known as his wife is trying to be an 'influencer.' Makes you wonder."</p><p>The timing is notable, as the Deckers and their children recently starred in a back-to-school campaign for DSW, per <a href=#>People</a>. Neither parent has provided further comment on the situation, however, and Forrest has not shared any more rogue selfies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmpmaX51e9OhnGadop6wbrDEnKKeql2jwqWxjKmfqKyfYrCwutOrpq%2BdoqjGbrnAsmSbnV2aw6a6jKyrq5menLKzedOhmKdlp5p6p7XRrKtmrJikwqi002g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
