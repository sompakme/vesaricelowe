The company has over 6,000 stores scattered around the United States, Mexico, and Brazil. As a company that employs thousands of workers and attracts thousands of customers every day, it’s safe to say that AutoZone has well-established standards, including a dress code for its employees.</p><p>The dress code at AutoZone varies by position and location, but there are general rules that apply to all employees. In this article, we will break down the AutoZone dress code by position, what is and is not allowed, and common FAQs related to the dress code.</p><h2><span id=Dress_Code_by_Position>Dress Code by Position</span></h2><p>AutoZone has several positions, including manager, assistant manager, and sales associate. The dress code requirements are not the same for all positions; the manager and assistant manager have different dress codes than the sales associates.</p><h3><span id=Manager_and_Assistant_Manager_Dress_Code>Manager and Assistant Manager Dress Code</span></h3><p>For the manager and assistant manager positions, the dress code is business-casual. That means collared shirts, dress pants, and dress shoes are required. Managers are expected to dress appropriately for meetings, customer visits, and other business activities.</p><h3><span id=Sales_Associate_Dress_Code>Sales Associate Dress Code</span></h3><p>The dress code for sales associates is casual, but clothing must be neat, clean, and professional. The company’s guidelines indicate that employees must wear clothing that is “appropriate for the job” and “fits appropriately” and that “offensive slogans or symbols are prohibited.”</p><h2><span id=What_is_allowed_in_the_dress_code>What is allowed in the dress code?</span></h2><p>AutoZone’s dress code allows for a wide range of clothing items, provided they meet the company’s standards for neatness, cleanliness, and professionalism. Here are some of the items that are allowed:</p><ul><li>Polos, dress shirts, or blouses</li><li>Dress pants or khakis</li><li>Dress shoes, loafers, or sneakers (non-athletic)</li><li>Dresses or skirts that are knee-length or longer</li><li>Clean and well-maintained denim jeans</li><li>Sweaters and cardigans</li><li>Company-branded t-shirts, sweatshirts, and jackets</li></ul><h2><span id=What_is_not_allowed_in_the_dress_code>What is not allowed in the dress code?</span></h2><p>While AutoZone has relaxed its dress code compared to some other companies, there are still some clothing items that are not allowed.
