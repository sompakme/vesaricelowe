She had been texting her staff 15 minutes before the collision.</p><p>Scout Whiteley, 20, met Stott two years ago when she interviewed to be a receptionist at her spa. She is now the business manager for Clover Skin Bar.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on shock death">Read more on shock death</h2><p>Whiteley said she and Stott grew the <a href=#>business</a> together.</p><p>"This was her first job, so we kind of learned the ropes together," said Whiteley. "We spent every day together for years."</p><p>Whiteley was the first person Stott told she was pregnant.</p><p>"I had a baby shower for my dog," said Whiteley with a chuckle. "We photoshopped an image of my dog's face on an ultrasound, and I showed it to her, and that's when she pulled out hers."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>Whiteley said Stott was going to be the best <a href=#>mother</a>.</p><p>"Anything she touched was love. She turned everything into gold. She's just magic," said Whiteley. "I knew that she would be and is the most incredible mother. I'm grateful that we had that [moment] before she passed."</p><p>Whiteley had been battling kidney failure when she met Stott, who often accompanied her in the hospital.</p><p>"She spent nights with me in the hospital," recounted Whiteley. "It wasn't your typical boss-employee relationship. She was our best friend before anything else."</p><p>Whiteley and her coworkers could only describe Parker and Stott's relationship in one word: "soulmates."</p><p>Parker, a construction worker, built Stott's spa "from the ground up," said Whiteley.</p><p>"He built the walls in this place. She picked out all the finishes. They did that whole project together. He was here all the time supporting the girls," said Whiteley. "They were like our parents fairy godparents."</p><p>Whiteley says that this time last year, Stott helped her grieve the death of a close friend.</p><p>"I told her in the future, with the people that I lose, I didn't want to treat it the same way," said Whiteley, choking back tears.</p><p>"I feel like my role with her being gone is to just make sure that her girls are okay and that her family is okay. And that Clover stays alive," said Whiteley. "We want to keep her legacy and her memory alive in this place that her and Parker have built."</p><p>"She was an angel on earth, she's an angel in heaven," said Whiteley through tears.</p><p>Lexie Lewis, 20, is a master esthetician at Clover Skin Bar. She said she has been turning to her loved ones for support during this tough time.</p><p>"It's helped so much and just seeing like the impact they made, or like Chloe made on so many people's lives, like looking through the GoFundMe, like all the messages on her Instagram posts," said Lewis.</p><p>"I feel like just seeing that helps so much because she made her imprint in the world that she needed to. And everyone knows that."</p><p>Demeree Frost, 20, is the social media manager and master esthetician at Clover Skin Bar.</p><p>Frost said Stott told the rest of her employees at the company holiday dinner that she was having a <a href=#>baby</a>.</p><p>"Since January, when I met her, it was always very clear how much she wanted to be a mom. She talked about it all the time. And she was almost a mom to us," said Frost.</p><p>"We would refer to Parker as mom and dad before she was even pregnant. She was just a mother in so many ways. Because them more than anyone, that's something they had wanted for forever."</p><p>In an Instagram <a aria-label="post (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a> from the account Parker and Chloe Forever (<a href=#>@parkerandchloeforever</a>), their baby's name was revealed.</p><p>"Baby Benjamin Gary Stott," read the caption, with a picture of the couple holding a picture of their ultrasound.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In memory of Stott, Clover Skin Spa offers a "Forever Facial," which includes dermaplaning, LED light therapy, and epicutis lipid masks.
