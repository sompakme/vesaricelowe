On the internet, it's <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Erykah Badu</a> who had fans cutting up over her comments on the big game.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Perfect day to cheat with a soft dude," the 52-year-old remarked on Twitter/x, earning upwards of 25K likes. "Men gone be watchin' football," Badu further noted of her reason for promoting infidelity. Longtime fans of the genre-bending performer know that she has a great sense of humour and loves to show that side of herself on social media, but of course, at least one user was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">offended</a> by the joke.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-erykah-badu-offers-super-bowl-sunday-advice>Erykah Badu Offers Super Bowl Sunday Advice</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"You too old for this," they told Badu, who didn't hesitate to match their energy. "Your eyes are very close together ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è," the mother of two remarked, shutting down unsolicited feedback with quickness. "Yeah she really should have minded her business on this one Ms. Badu," one of the singer's loyal supporters gassed her diss up.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-negative-response-earns-clap-back-from-the-healer>Negative Response Earns Clap Back from "The Healer"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the early hours of Tuesday (February 13) morning, Erykah Badu sent out another tweet addressing those offended by her words. "And if [you] mad about that tweet... Unfollow me. I don't trust people with no sense of humor. Beat it," she confidently declared.
