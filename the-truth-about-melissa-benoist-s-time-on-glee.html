In 2012, she told <a href=#>Teen Vogue</a>, "I first auditioned in New York at the Roundabout Theatre Company, and then went through five auditions all with different songs ... And then I had two screen tests in California for [creator] Ryan Murphy and his team." She was a fan of the show before auditioning, and later got to act and perform alongside the cast she watched as a viewer.&nbsp;Benoist also met her now <a href=#>ex-husband Blake Jenner</a> on the set, and became friendly with her other co-stars. She continued, "Everyone is so nice, welcoming, and fun to be around."</p><p dir=ltr>Once the curtains closed on "Glee," Benoist continued to juggle her acting career with music. In 2017, she added perfect pitch to Supergirl's long list of superpowers in <a href=#>a crossover musical episode of "The Flash."</a> Given that the Flash is played by none other than Grant Gustin, who portrayed Sebastian Smythe on "Glee," the episode was a reunion that returned to the actors' roots. Then in 2018, Benoist displayed her vocal chops once again in the Carole King Broadway musical "Beautiful." However, long after her time on "Glee," later events showed Benoist wouldn't make it away unscathed from the show's signature off-screen drama.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhibIJ3go6tn55lpKfCtbSMmpmoraRiuqa4yKyqmmWSmruwtdKtqmasmaKybrvNZp6lnZVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
