These dates eventually came and went, much to the chagrin of fans. There were even some listening parties that made huge waves. Unfortunately, no music was actually released in the direct aftermath of all of this.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Since that time, the release date for Vultures has been moved and pushed back numerous times. In fact, it feels like every single day, there is a new release date on Apple Music. Furthermore, with this project being labeled as Volume 1, there has been some debate over just how many volumes there are going to be. Well, it appears as though we finally have our answer. While taking to his Instagram story, Ye revealed that he would be dropping three volumes of Vultures. Moreover, he even revealed some release dates.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kanye-west-vultures-is-imminent>Kanye West "Vultures" Is Imminent</h2></span><p>Image via Instagram</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Firstly, the first <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">volume will be released on February 9th.</a> This makes sense given the fact that this is a release date that had been previously announced. Secondly, Volume 2 is going to come out on March 8th. Finally, the third and final volume is set for April 5th. This is obviously huge news for Ye fans, although many are still skeptical of whether or not he can get it done. He still has a long way to go, and it will ultimately depend on how many tracks he plans to release in each volume. Either way, this will come as good news to those who are still sticking by Ye.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of this announcement, in the comments section below.
