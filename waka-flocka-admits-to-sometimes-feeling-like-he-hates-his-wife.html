"I want more," he told his mother. "There's too many dictators in my life and it's my life." Deb wanted him to explain what he meant. "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I need more control over my life</a>." Still, Deb told him it doesn't make sense. Waka replied that he lives "20 lives."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I got a lotta [businesses], I got a career, I gotta be this role model," the rapper continued. "I gotta be this father. This a lot, ma." He admitted that although he's stressed <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">by being pulled in different directions, </a>he hadn't communicated with his wife. "'Cause we gon' bump heads. Sometimes she irritates me, sometimes she don't. Sometimes I don't wanna be in the house. Some days I wake up [and] I hate my wife."
