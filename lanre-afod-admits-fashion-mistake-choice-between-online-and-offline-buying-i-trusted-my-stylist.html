However, one cannot avoid buying items online. If I have the opportunity, I prefer to see it myself and test it to know if it is suitable for me."<h2>Lanre shares his fashion mistake</h2><p class=align-left>He recalled when he got an invite from his colleague <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Boma Akpore</a> to attend a movie premiere.

I spoke to my designer that I wanted a certain style. I trusted her because she had always given me what I desired. She had packaged it and I did not bother to check it. I went to the event directly from the premiere and I wore my outfit but it did not fit at all. It did not even go well with my shoes."<h2>Lanre Afod speaks on his hair</h2><p class=align-left>Earlier, Legit.ng reported that actor Lanre had shared why he <a href=#>kept long hair</a> and the perception some filmmakers have about him.</p><p class=align-left>In an interview with Legit.ng, he shared his most expensive fashion accessory and how he got it.</p><p class=align-left>He also spoke about how fans have evolved from judging actors based on the roles they play in <a href=#>movies</a>.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6fmKygmaS7cH2Ucm5tcGBiuaK60Z5kmp6fmXqisMyiq6xllpbAqbXOp2SmoaOprqyx0manq52Wmr%2BmusKeZKimnJ67pnnOn52loZ6aerS0zqmnoqaXZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
