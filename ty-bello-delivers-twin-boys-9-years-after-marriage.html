She secretly got married in 2005.</p><p>However, only close friends and family members were aware of her pregnancy, which makes the news of her delivery to be a surprise to many.</p><p>According to Kemi Filani, the singer's best friend Rita Springer confirmed the News saying <i>“These two were born Saturday and they are going to change their Nation, I can feel it”</i></p><p>The new mother was said to have posted photos of different adorable babies on her instagram page few days to her delievery with this caption:</p><p><i>"I love photographing babies, yet nothing terrifies me more. Tell me I’m photographing the queen of England tomorrow and I’ll be fine. I’ll go to sleep , knowing that ‘ Hey ,she’s human! As long as that remains true,I’ll break-in , Break-through or Break -her-down… Some how…I’m always up for a challenge … Especially when I’m told someone is ‘difficult’ .</i></p><p><i>I’ve been blessed to photograph countless world leaders, international celebrities and people I’ve only dreamt I’ll get a glimpse of and always did just fine. Tell me, I’m shooting a baby or child aged 3months to 2 years and I’m immediately humbled. Torture me by letting me know 2 weeks in advance and I won’t be able to stop thinking about it. With babies and toddlers, I’m not doing all that fancy breaking-them-down or nothing.! They’re are THE BOSS.</i></p><p><i>Breaking YOU down.You learn to stoop and see where they’ll take you.., but ooooh …nothing can be more rewarding than when they gift you with their essence. To curb my ‘respect’ for these folks.. I throw myself in the deep end by creatively photographing a crèche and nursery every year. nothing cures you faster than trying to create magic with not one but one hundred screaming babies and toddlers.</i></p><p><i>Nothing will make you question your reason for existing yet give you greater meaning for your being alive…the ‘greater meaning ‘part starts only after you gather up courage to look at your contact sheets on your screen about two weeks after your ‘beautifully’ life altering experience . Babies rule supreme. #tybellophotography #photostories #babies”</i></p><p>It would be recalled that just recently, <a href=#>the singer-photographer got a surprise birthday party from some her friends.</a></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHGAk29uZqypYq%2BmuMuoZJ2dnJ7Dpr7SZquwoZ5ir7DF0mZwZrGVlr%2B0ecCfq56qXaKus77Imp6eZpipuq0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
