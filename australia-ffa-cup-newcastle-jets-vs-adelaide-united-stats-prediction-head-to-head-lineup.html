The hosts won on every single occasion, and they managed to do so without any deficits.</p><p>Of the 22 home games, the home team won 14 of them. In 13 meetings between the two competing sides, each won six times. The last game between the two teams was in January at McDonald Jones Stadium where Adelaide came back from one down in the last few minutes to win.</p><p>The Adelaide United vs Newcastle Jets match is at home, and there will be a few members of the team missing. The team’s three long-term absentees are Nick Ansell, Kusini Yengi, and James Delianov. They did not travel last week or this week.</p><p>One player on the Newcastle Jets will not be playing for the team for their game against Adelaide due to injury. The team won’t be able to use the services of Ben Kantarovski who has been out of service in a year.</p><p>Starting lineup for Newcastle Jets: Michael Weier (GK); Dane Ingham, Jordan Elsey, Matthew Jurman, Jason Hoffman; Jordan O’Doherty, Angus Thurgate; Olivier Boumal, Daniel Penha, Savvas Siatravanis; Valentino Yuel</p><p>This game is a close one, with both sides scoring almost the same number of goals. Adelaide has been stronger defensively, while Newcastle’s offense can’t match their defense.</p><p>The winning streak of the hosts gives them the advantage over their opponents. It is expected that they are going to win the match with a narrow victory.</p><p>After a disappointing season in which they missed the playoffs, Adelaide United will be looking to rebound this season. They’ve added some quality players in the off-season and should contend for a top four spot. Newcastle Jets, on the other hand, have been fairly quiet in the transfer market and may struggle to score goals. Expect another close game with few clear cut chances separating the sides at full time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6usrZ6bvK2wjZympmeRqsC1vsCloJpllpuubq%2FUqWSnnaeYrrTAy55ko52kqHq3v4yam56kkZ6xpnnUp6CtnZRiwLWt06xkqaqVmbakwMiopWaglZaxbsDOZp%2BemZRiuaq6xK6nrKSZq7K0wNGemKZlkaOxbrPRqKynnF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
