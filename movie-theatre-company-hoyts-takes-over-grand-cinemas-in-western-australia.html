Cinema operator Hoyts has acquired four existing cinemas; one in Bunbury and three in Perth – in the suburbs of Currambine, Warwick and Joondalup. All were previously owned by Grand Cinemas.
The buyout comes after the iconic WA cinema giant – which started out as a family business nearly 100 years ago – shut its doors in November."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Still WA-owned and focused, the Grand Theatre Company is proud of its history – nearly as long as the movie industry itself – and status as one of Australia’s oldest independent film exhibitors.”</p><p>The closure left devoted fans and movie lovers devastated with many taking to social media to express their sorrow over the loss.</p><p>“Deeply saddened as I attended sometimes up to three times a week. I love the cinema so much. This is terrible and I am sorry for all the staff impacted. You guys were truly one of the last safe, fun, affordable outing venues in Perth. Again gee wiz,” one loyal customer wrote.</p><p>“Come on WA don’t give up on this WA-owned business. Get some friends together and go and watch a movie,” another urged.</p><p>It’s hoped the rebranding will “preserve the local community’s access” to the big-screen, which comes just in time for school holidays.</p><p>“We see cinema as having a critical role in the local community, forming such a big part of cultural development,” Hoyts’ director of sales, marketing and content Stephanie Mills, said in a statement.</p><p>Grand Cinemas started out as a group of “great old theatres in the heart of Perth”, before embracing the drive-in era, which coincided with the expansion throughout the city’s suburbs.</p><p>It eventually returned to its city roots with the multi-screen Cinema City near the Perth Town Hall and later established “a chain of hi-tech multi-screen complexes” in the early ’90s, first in Warwick in 1993 followed by Bunbury and then Currambine.</p><p>In 2004, the company took over the Joondalup and Whitford City multi-screen theatres from Greater Union and in 2005 it opened its sixth complex in Armadale.</p><p>In 2014, it adopted the Gold Lounge trend at Grand Cinemas Warwick, and the following year it opened its “state-of-the-art Dolby Atmos cinema at Grand Cinemas Currambine”, described as “the first of its kind in Western Australia”.</p><p>Grand Cinemas customers who hold a current loyalty card will receive a free 12-month membership with Hoyts in line with the rebranding.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Hoyts operates over 50 cinemas across Australia and New Zealand, with over 400 screens and 50,000 seats. Hoyts is owned by Chinese conglomerate the Wanda Group.</p><p>The cinema giant now has nine cinemas across Western Australia, which offer Xtreme Screen, Lux and D-box experiences at selected venues.</p><p><i>– With Alexis Carey</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyjwdKipZ6ro2S6prDImmacoZ6auqJ5wqGYoqZdnby6wNJmmauhnpzAbsPAZqSorpmaerSvxKecZqyfYrmqssRmnaiknKTEqrrGZp6rmZ6ZeqS1zZ6kmqtdmLytuMCpqp5nnprEtHnSraarsV9phHaEkWxsm2uTlq6ng8NxnHBwYmiDooGQa5uaapNrrw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
