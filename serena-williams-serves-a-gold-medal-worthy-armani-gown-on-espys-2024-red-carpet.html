Her dress's sculpted bra was fully embroidered in twinkling gold, while the train was coated in gold Swarovski crystals. Together, they gave her black column gown a refined, layered effect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uFvdDbvScoW6LapuqFwpL4-1920-80.jpg><p>The back of her gown continued the embellishments featured on the front, with a V-cut silhouette. She matched the diamond-like shimmer of her dress to star-like drop earrings that dusted her curls.</p><p>After walking the carpet solo, Williams was joined by her husband, Alexis Ohanian, and her first child, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. Alexis wore a sweet shimmery pink dress and metallic gold sandals, while her father wore a black suit and blue Nike sneakers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CpymyiZwKdGtpae4J4Fcaj-1920-80.jpg><p>If fashion could earn a gold medal, this dress would be a contender. Williams's look was understated, but still glamorous—just the sort of gown to command the theatre as host while spotlighting the evening's award-winners. Her blonde, old Hollywood waves only emphasized the dress's elegance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vu3ZqDSpETeSRoDQG3JD2V-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kNK8aGr9dfDLc7MwMuHyqQ-1920-80.jpg><p>Williams accentuated the gold detailing on her dress with an equally medal-worthy manicure by nail artist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/sreyninpeng/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Sreynin Peng</a>. Her fingers were polished with a gold-chrome polish matching the train of her dress. "Since she would have many looks throughout the night, we wanted to focus on her red carpet look for inspiration," Peng said in a statement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xi9Ry9bmGgWHeqme3L9pkN-1920-80.jpg><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/serena-williams/>Serena Williams</a>'s relationship with style is a legendary one.

Attending the Essence Festival in New Orleans earlier this month, she hit the carpet in a sultry black midi dress by Dolce & Gabbana. Weeks before, stopping by the Tribeca Film Festival for the premiere of her documentary, In The Arena: Serena Williams, she wore a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/serena-williams-pink-corset-dress/>pink corset dress</a> by the same Italian house.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8SNLNo2uAPEGJyZyrf3eFi-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BSErrRiic7H9gxkYkDWeY8-1920-80.jpg><p>Tonight, Williams is presiding over a ceremony honoring the greatest feats in sports over the past year, as well as those who've made an impact through related philanthropies. Her friends <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-harry/>Prince Harry</a> and Meghan Markle are expected to attend, as Prince Harry receives the Pat Tillman Award for Service. (The appointment has come with some criticism, but the former royals are reportedly <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/royals/prince-harry-meghan-markle-not-paying-attention-to-espys-criticism/>not paying attention to it</a>.) On the athletics front, NCAA-turned-WNBA phenomenon <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/caitlin-clark-wnba-draft-2024-prada-outfit/>Caitlin Clark</a> is the most nominated player of the evening.</p><p>The guest with the most outfit changes is undoubtedly Williams. Her team hinted that she would have several looks throughout the night. Custom Armani Privé is a shimmering start.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJ6RqLWqu81oqp6qlaOubsPIpaOimZ2oeqK%2BzJqlomWXpMSvecSsp7Jlkayus7DSZmlpamRiv6awjJyYq6iVqXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
