Earlier this week, it was announced that he's opened a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">new G-Unit&nbsp;Films and Television studio in Louisiana</a>. He's leasing Millennium Studio in Shreveport, paying just over $2K per year on top of maintenance fees to use the space. Councilwoman Tabatha Taylor explained why the city council voted in favor of the deal amid the announcement. "We already know that 50 Cent is a mighty mogul in the entertainment business," she explained. "But, the residual effects for local businesses here is what's going to be felt. We have rebranded Shreveport in the entertainment industry, and now we are considering ourselves back again as an entertainment mecca."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Fif shared some photos of the building on Instagram in celebration, boasting about his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">latest endeavor</a>. "All Roads lead to Shreveport if you ready to work in film and television," he wrote. "G-unit studios Is officially in Louisiana. BOOM GLG."
