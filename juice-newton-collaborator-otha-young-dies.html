He played and sang on every one of her albums, including her 1981 breakthrough, “Juice,” which featured the hits “Angel of the Morning” and “Queen of Hearts.”</p><p>The two first teamed as the folk duo Dixie Peach in Northern California. Their brand of progressive country rock developed as they went on to form the band Juice Newton and Silver Spur. Moving to Los Angeles, they recorded for RCA and Capitol under Newton’s name starting in the mid-’70s.</p><p>Young wrote primarily for Newton, though other artists cut his songs. A Christmas album of standards and originals recently was completed on which Otha served as lead guitarist, writer, producer and vocalist.
