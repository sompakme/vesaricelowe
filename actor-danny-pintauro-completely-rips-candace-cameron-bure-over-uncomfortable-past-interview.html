According to <a href=#>People</a>, in 1997, Pintauro made the brave decision to come out as gay. Then in 2015, Pintauro decided to live his full truth and share he was HIV positive in an interview with Oprah Winfrey.</p><p>The decision to go public about his story was not easy, and it was made even more difficult when Bure interviewed Pintauro. The actor appeared on "<a href=#>The View</a>" in 2015 after the revelation, and during the interview, Bure asked Pintauro, "Do you take responsibility for your actions? For being promiscuous." The situation only worsened when Bure's co-host Raven-Symoné directly asked the actor and his husband if they have unprotected sex. At the time, Pintauro brushed off the comment and responded cordially. But as he reflects on it now, he realizes how disrespectful the comments were.</p><p>Pintauro spoke on the "<a href=#>Behind The Velvet Rope</a>" podcast about how "disappointed" he was in Bure. He said, "I mean, it was horrifying. It was one of the lowest moments of the journey after coming out to Oprah." The actor continued, saying that Bure must know plenty of people in the LGBTQ+ community, so how she "got to this place is ... concerning." But despite their bad blood, Pintauro still said Bure could be "a great ally" if she "could open herself up again."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlnZ4VxfI6amq2nomKxorrNsmSpoZ6prra%2BzmaaqKWgobK1scuyZKuhoKh6pK3NnZicnV2Yrq6x0ailZpqlp7Juu9WeqWatnpi8rrLOq6uampyaerGt0q1koqakmr%2B3tcSwZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
