I'm in a relationship that is with one of the most beautiful people I've met in life," Common told her. "She's smart, she loves God, she has something real down to earth about her. She's talented.

She had to get her own talk show."</p><p>For context, Hudson is one of only 19 people to ever get awarded an EGOT, i.e. an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony.
