And this was it.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E64Gtd2n9hbWw9cT82xyB4-1920-80.jpg><p>When Kate arrived at the Royal Box at Centre Court on Sunday, accompanied by daughter <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/princess-charlotte/>Princess Charlotte</a> and sister Pippa Middleton Matthews, she looked visibly moved by the standing ovation she received, and her decision to attend “showed a lot of courage and character, as she knew that the world was watching,” said royal biographer Robert Jobson, whose latest, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.amazon.com/Catherine-Princess-Wales-Biography-Future/dp/1639367128 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FCatherine-Princess-Wales-Biography-Future%2Fdp%2F1639367128%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon><u>Catherine: The Princess of Wales</u></a>, is out August 6.</p><p>People reports Kate “appeared to have gained some comfort from the reception and being out and about,” and royal photographer Karwai Tang said of her entrance to the tournament that “She usually comes in, walks down and into her seat,” Tang said. “But she stood for a while and took it all in. For her to acknowledge it and take in the applause was special. Wimbledon has been waiting with bated breath for her to return, and she was back.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yV4D2Fp9a9owuPo8GrLVje-1920-80.jpg><p>A source close to the royal household said “It’s good not to feel under pressure and just take her time and have slow days if she needs to,” they said. To that point, Jobson said the shift in priorities around her health as she continues to receive treatment for cancer has been crucial.</p><p>“Before, she used to live her life by the calendar, and now she is living her life, and the calendar comes in after,” Jobson said. “She will be back, but when you have had an experience like this, it changes your perspective and the order of things.”</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
