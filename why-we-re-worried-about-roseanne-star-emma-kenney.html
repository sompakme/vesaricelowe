"It wasn't healthy, and it was making me feel even worse — anxious and depressed," she said, explaining that she recognized the "slippery slope" she was headed down. "Now, in treatment, I will work on finding other ways to cope with boredom, find hobbies and better learn how to deal with stress."</p><p>On an episode of <a href=#>The Talk</a>, Kenney's Roseanne co-star Sara Gilbert gave Kenney props for having taken these matters into her own hands. "If I could go back to being 18 and start doing things to better myself at the pace you're doing, I would be a better person today," Gilbert said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamloZoBye9aoqauhlZl6s7vSnpinppViwLWt0WacpqWRYrimus2esGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
