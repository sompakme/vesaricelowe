A number of tech giants are now investing heavily in the artificial intelligence space and coming up with their own chatbots.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Anthropic, a firm founded by former OpenAI employees, has now launched another AI chatbot named Claude. The Google-backed company says the new assistant is a safer version of the AI, which is ‘less likely to produce harmful outputs.’ Read on to know all the features and advantages of Claude.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.llanelliherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-05-001538-1024x472.jpg alt width=1024 height=472 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><span style=font-weight:400>Claude AI Chatbot by Anthropic Promises to be a Safe Assistant</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Just like ChatGPT, Claude can perform a variety of functions, including ‘summarization, search, creative and collaborative writing, Q&A, and coding,’ says Anthropic. The chatbot can carry out several conversational and text-processing tasks with high accuracy, reliability, and predictability.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Claude has been designed in such a way that it is much less likely to produce any harmful output, so it is touted as ‘a safer assistant.’ It is also said to be more steerable and easier to converse with. The chatbot’s personality, tone, and behavior can also be changed by the user, giving a more personalized and comprehensive experience.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.llanelliherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-anthropic.png alt width=750 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><span style=font-weight:400>Two Versions of Claude have been Launched</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Anthropic has launched two versions of Claude: a Standard version and an Instant version. The former is pitched as ‘a state-of-the-art high-performance model,’ while Claude Instant is faster and cheaper and is based on a lighter model. The company has revealed that there will be further updates in the chatbots in the upcoming weeks.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Interested users can sign up for early access to Claude on Anthropic’s official website. The chatbot is also being offered to businesses and nonprofits through API. However, the pricing for API access has not been revealed yet. The AI chatbot has been launched just a few weeks after Google invested $300 million in Anthropic in February.</span></p><h2><span style=font-weight:400>Anthropic Partnered with Notion, Quora, and DuckDuckGo to Improve Capabilities of Claude</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Anthropic says that they gave access to the chatbot to companies like Notion, Quora, and DuckDuckGo in the past few months to test its features and improve its capabilities. “Users describe Claude’s answers as detailed and easily understood, and they like that exchanges feel like natural conversation,” said the Head of People and Comms at Quora, Autumn Besselman.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.llanelliherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/qdwwcf-1024x576.png alt width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Akshay Kothari, Co-Founder & COO of Notion, added, “Anthropic and Notion share a common goal of helping individuals and enterprises leverage AI to increase productivity. Claude’s uniquely creative writing and summarization abilities contribute to the development of our connected AI assistant, Notion AI. Notion users can now work more efficiently and improve their writing skills, all within the Notion workspace.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Steve Fischer, Chief Business Officer at DuckDuckGo, also released a statement: “We’re thrilled to be working with Anthropic on DuckAssist, the first Instant Answer in our search results to use natural language technology to generate answers to search queries using Wikipedia and other related sources.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“Anthropic has already been a great partner, working closely with us to improve the quality of DuckAssist answers while also meeting our strict privacy requirements. We’re looking forward to continuing this partnership.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For more news and updates, keep watching this space.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbjAp5ylpJmdsrOty51lnKedZH54fo6co5qtlJp6orWMnJ%2BarJKkwW6u2GaYp6yYp7yxtcJmnZ6ZpKq%2Fpr%2BMqJ1mrJiaeqS0wK2eqaxdp7a3rctmnLGonKS%2FprCO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
