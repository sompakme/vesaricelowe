But what happens when Kitty moves to Korea to reunite with her long-distance boyfriend Dae? That’s the premise of XO, Kitty, the Netflix spin-off series that follows Kitty’s adventures in love, friendship, and identity at the same boarding school that her late mother attended.</p><p>The first season of XO, Kitty premiered on May 18, 2023, and received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. The show was praised for its diverse and charming cast, its witty and heartfelt writing, and its exploration of themes such as culture, sexuality, and family. The second season was released on September 9, 2023, and continued Kitty’s journey of self-discovery and romance, with more twists and turns along the way.</p><p>But what about the third season? Will there be one? And if so, when will it come out? What will happen to Kitty and her love interests? Who will be in the cast? And where can you watch it? In this article, we will answer all these questions and more, based on the information we have gathered from various sources. So, without further ado, let’s get started!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Will_there_be_a_third_season_of_XO_Kitty></span><strong>Will there be a third season of XO, Kitty?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The good news is that yes, there will be a third season of XO, Kitty. Netflix officially confirmed the renewal of the show on December 14, 2023, in a video announcement featuring the main cast members. The video showed Anna Cathcart (who plays Kitty) holding a sign that read “XO, Kitty Season 3 is coming!” and the rest of the cast cheering and celebrating. You can watch the video&nbsp;here.</p><p>The bad news is that the third season will also be the final season of the show. According to the creator and executive producer Jenny Han, who is also the author of the To All the Boys books, the decision to end the show after three seasons was made to give the story a satisfying and meaningful conclusion. She said in a statement:</p><p>We are so grateful to Netflix for allowing us to tell Kitty’s story and share it with the world. We are also so thankful to our amazing cast and crew, who have poured their hearts and souls into this show. We have had so much fun creating this show and we hope that the fans will enjoy the final season as much as we did. We are sad to say goodbye to Kitty and her friends, but we are also excited to see them grow and find their happy endings.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_will_XO_Kitty_Season_3_come_out></span><strong>When will XO, Kitty Season 3 come out?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Netflix has not announced the exact release date of the third season of XO, Kitty yet, but we can make some predictions based on the previous seasons. The first season came out on May 18, 2023, and the second season came out on September 9, 2023, which means that there was a gap of about four months between them. If we assume that the same pattern will continue, we can expect the third season to come out sometime in January or February 2024.</p><p>However, this is just a speculation and there might be some delays or changes due to various factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the production schedule, and the availability of the cast and crew. Therefore, we advise you to keep an eye on the official social media accounts of the show and Netflix for any updates or announcements regarding the release date.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_will_happen_in_the_third_season_of_XO_Kitty></span><strong>What will happen in the third season of XO, Kitty?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The third season of XO, Kitty will pick up where the second season left off, and will follow Kitty as she returns to Portland with an unexpected guest: Min Ho, the rich and popular boy who confessed his feelings for her on the plane. Kitty will have to deal with the consequences of her actions, such as breaking up with Dae, leaving Yuri hanging, and hurting Q’s friendship. She will also have to face her family, who are unaware of her situation and expect her to graduate from KISS.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Korea, Dae will try to move on from Kitty and focus on his music career, but he will still have hopes of winning her back. Yuri will struggle with her feelings for Kitty and her relationship with Julianna, who has returned to KISS after a year abroad. Q will be angry and hurt by Kitty’s betrayal, and will seek revenge by teaming up with Madison, Kitty’s nemesis. And Min Ho will try to fit in with Kitty’s life in Portland, while hiding a secret that could change everything.</p><p>The third season will also introduce some new characters, such as Kitty’s cousin Margot, who is visiting from Scotland, and Bonaventure, a French exchange student who will catch Kitty’s eye. The season will also feature some familiar faces from the To All the Boys universe, such as Lara Jean, Peter, John Ambrose, and Gen, who will make cameo appearances and offer some advice to Kitty.</p><p>The third season will be the final chapter of Kitty’s story, and will wrap up all the loose ends and cliffhangers from the previous seasons.
