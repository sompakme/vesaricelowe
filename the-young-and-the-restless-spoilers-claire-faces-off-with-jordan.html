Hayley has brought a vulnerable side to Claire that has Y&R fans feeling for her despite everything she has done.</p><p>Claire taking on Jordan brings another layer to the character, and Hayley has given insight into what’s driving her alter ego. The obvious, of course, is that the only parent Claire had in her life betrayed her so badly.</p><p>“To be betrayed by the person who is supposed to be your confidante and your guiding light, that’s got to be so painful. I can’t imagine it. So the need to tell Jordan how Claire feels is a necessary part of the healing process, to finally let that person know that you see through them and that you know what they’ve done,” the actress explained to <a href=#>Soap Opera Digest.</a></p><p>Even though Cole and Victoria grant Claire her wish of seeing Jordan, The Young and the Restless fans shouldn’t expect a happy family reunion any time soon.
