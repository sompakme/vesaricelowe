She was listed as&nbsp;<a href=#>El Paso’s most wanted fugitive back in 2019</a>&nbsp;due to interference with child custody and being an “aggravated kidnapping facilitate.” Now it appears her $3 billion lawsuit against The Rock and other WWE Superstars has been dismissed.</p><p>Last year in October, Rhaka Khan – real name Trenesha Biggers, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, claiming “conspiracy to kidnap” Biggers and her children. The lawsuit was filed against over two-dozen defendants, including The Rock, Nikki Bella, Mick Foley, Maryse, The Miz, Jim Cornette, Billy Corgan, and even the late Chris Benoit.</p><p>As previously reported, her $3 billion lawsuit against The Rock and the other aforementioned Superstars moved forward. In March this year, Biggers received notification by mail at her home address in New York City. However, none of the defendants have been served with legal proceedings at this time.</p><p>According to <a href=#>PWInsider</a>, on 10th October, United States District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain dismissed the second amended lawsuit brought by Trenesha Biggers. It was further added that had been no movement on the case for months before the original dismissal back in June this year.</p><p>In December 2022, a bench warrant was issued for Biggers’ arrest by Texas courts after she failed to attend her criminal trial in El Paso, Texas. The charges against her include interference with child custody and “aggravated kidnapping facilitate.” The warrant for her arrest is still active according to Texas court records.</p><p>What’s your take on Rhaka Khan’s lawsuit?
