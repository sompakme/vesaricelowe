While rare, parrot owners have lost eyes, fingers, and toes to their pet birds, while others have sustained traumatic injuries to their lips, ears, and noses.<h2>Which parrot is least likely to bite?</h2>Although just about every parrot varies with their biting tendencies, usually Cockatiels, Budgies, and Pionus parrots are the least likely to actually bite. Keep in mind, this doesn't mean they never bite, all it means is that they're not as likely to bite as some other parrot species.<h2>How long can you leave parrots alone?</h2>Parrots are social animals and are unhappy when left alone. They require company and need human interaction for a minimum of two hours a day while not being alone for longer than six or eight hours at the most. Your bird should spend enough time with you to feel like you are its flock, its companion.<h2>How do parrots recognize their owners?</h2>A parakeet will know you by appearance and scent. This enables parakeets to bond with one person. If another person provides care for the parrot, it may reject their assistance.

As a result, the parrot sees you as its mate, making life awkward for both of you. If your parrot shows signs of sexual attraction towards you, you must discourage this behavior.<h2>Do parrots understand human language?</h2>Parrots aren't advanced enough to distinguish between our languages.
