A New York Times investigation into bariatric procedures performed at Bellevue Hospital in <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Manhattan</a> found that 11 prisoners from <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Rikers Island</a> had undergone the surgery, after which patients are supposed to consume a protein-rich diet. One of the prisoners claims they weren’t told about the challenges that would be involved in recovering while incarcerated—when they would not be able to control their food intake—adding that a doctor had used pressure tactics in convincing him to agree to the operation. Two prisoners told the Times they’d become malnourished and regretted having the surgery. Bellevue spokesperson Christopher Miller said the Rikers patients were “screened and assessed like all others” and had been kept in the hospital until they were capable of consuming the food available in the jail.</p><a class=ReadItAtLink href=# rel=noreferrer><span>Read it at </span><span class=ReadItAtLink__name>The New York Times</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfl7KtuMSvrJ5lmKTAsbXTmqNmqKWotaawjLCcop%2BYqXqtu9KsZKytopyys8WMqKVmqKKewLC6xKuqZq%2BYpHqzscKorZ6qlZl6qrqMo5iipF2jxrU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
