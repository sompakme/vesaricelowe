It was a lovely occasion.

The couple&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>welcomed their daughter Mabel&nbsp;in November 2016</a>. Russell, who was previously married to <a class=hm-link href=#>Katy Perry</a>, recently opened up about&nbsp;becoming a first-time father, telling John Bishop: "When she was born, I felt something really quite profound. I felt extremely present in that birth, completely overwhelmed by it. I've heard a lot of men say, 'I didn't know I had so much love in me', but I did know I had so much love in me. I just didn't know what to do with it. And when I saw her, I felt something switch on – this sense of very determined and clear purpose."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQcGdxamdpfnp%2Fk2iprqujmrmtecGrmKecXaKus77InqpmpJGqv6J5xpqjpZmTnbKzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
