The rap diva chiefly prefers booty-baring mini skirts and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">showing her panty</a>. Fox tends to explore more avant-garde style choices, such as the heart-shaped nipple pasties she rocked around the Big Apple on Friday (September 8). The Uncut Gems actress styled her long, red hair in two braids, complete with pretty black bows, almost emulating shirt sleeves running down her chest.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-julia-fox-is-a-true-new-yorker>Julia Fox is a True New Yorker</h2></span><p>Julia Fox is seen on September 08, 2023, in New York City.

She managed to keep ultra-low waist pants up while the paparazzi snapped her photo. Fox has been redefining her status as a style icon for the past few days, wearing everything from fairy wings to a two-piece set covered in watches.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Her bold, black outfit pictured above was swapped out for an all-white ensemble later that evening. The Italian-born starlet looked ethereal, as seen below, and only continues to prove how expansive her range (not to mention confidence) is.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">More of the Actresses' Best Fashion Week Looks</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Keep scrolling to see some of our favourite outfits Julia Fox has stepped out in over the past week.
