He was then expected to go to Webber International University as he was awarded a scholarship as he also played football.&nbsp;He refused to go to college because he wanted to get into professional wrestling.</span></p><p><span>He started fighting since high school.&nbsp;Back then, he was capable of winning the championship wrestling title until 2008 when he signed professionally with WWE.&nbsp;His first fight was against Kaleb O’Neal whom he defeated in Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW).</span></p><p><span>His previous fights were on teams with people like Kris Logan and Bray Wyatt who at the time was known as Duke Rotunda.&nbsp;After making some hits, he then started in singles.&nbsp;He also competed in the new NXT Championships spun off from FCW.&nbsp;He continued there until 2014.</span></p><p><span>From 2014 to 2016, he appeared on episodes of Raw and SmackDown.&nbsp;He then fought as a member of The Social Outcasts, then Miztourage and the B-Team.</span></p><p><span>Also known as Bo Washington or The Inspirational, the WWE Superstar has recorded a few feats as a wrestler including three FCW Florida Heavyweight Championships, two FCW Florida Tag Team Championships alongside his brother, and an NXT Championship.&nbsp;More so, he was ranked 73rd best wrestler in Pro Wrestling Illustrated’s top 500 wrestlers in 2014.</span></p><p><span>Although wrestling is his main activity, Bo Dallas also appeared in the movie&nbsp;</span><span>The Marine 5: Battleground</span><span>&nbsp;playing the role of Alonzo.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family, brother, sister and wife</span></strong></h2><p><span>As noted, Dallas comes from a family that is very popular in the wrestling community with almost every member of the family being part of it.&nbsp;The wrestler has a brother, Bray Wyatt (Windham Lawrence Rotunda) and a sister, Mika Rotunda.</span></p><p><span>Bray has also made a name for himself as a wrestler and he is even more successful than his younger brother, both members of the NXT show.&nbsp;Mika, on the other hand, is the only member of the rotunda wrestling clan who decided not to participate in the competition.&nbsp;She is a fitness trainer.</span></p><p><span>Dallas is married to Sarah Backman who is also a professional wrestler.&nbsp;She was born in Sweden on December 8, 1991. By the age of 14, Backman had already started as a wrestler.&nbsp;She grew to be very popular and became an eight-time WWE World Arm Wrestling Champion.</span></p><p><span>Dallas and Backman tied the knot in a private event in 2014. As of 2018, the couple still had no children.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Bo Dallas dead</span></strong><span>&nbsp;?</span></h2><p><span>In 2015, following a fight with Brock Lesnar in which he was mercilessly beaten, many believed that the ring artist died.&nbsp;Apart from that, Bo had also been absent from the arena for quite some time, leaving people wondering if he was really dead.&nbsp;Nevertheless, the truth is that he is very much alive and active as a wrestler.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height and width</span></strong></h2><p><span>There are people like Rey Mysterio and a few others who have broken convention, but most wrestlers who have signed up for WWE have good height and build.&nbsp;Rotunda also belongs to the class of top athletes and it is well built to survive wrestling, the football it started with, and many other sports.</span></p><p><span>That pointed out, he has a height that measures 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm) and a body weight of 234 lbs (106 kg).</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMm6ZmnJGhuaK%2FjLCgn51dnsButMRmm56ZlGK8s3nApaCvnV2otrTAxKtkm6qfqbWmvoyfmKahnK56orPEZp%2BeoZedwXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
