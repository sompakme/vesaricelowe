Specifically, this Instagram post from February 24:</p><p>So how did Swift fans look at this picture of palm trees and stars and conclude that Taylor was planning to release new music on April 26? A few things, actually.</p><p>First, the trees: April 26 is Arbor Day. This is the most rational and obvious clue in the post.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><p>Second, the stars: There are exactly 61 stars in the picture and April 26 is 61 days&nbsp;after&nbsp;February 24 (the day the 'gram was posted).</p><p>Does this sound insane? Not to Taylor Swift fans, who&nbsp;get&nbsp;the way her mind works, because they figured this out within HOURS of the initial Instagram:&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Crazy #TS7 Theory: So if there‚Äôs 60 stars as some have said, let‚Äôs say there‚Äôs about 60/61 ‚≠êÔ∏è There‚Äôs 61 days until April 26, FRIDAY, a SINGLE RELEASE day! Another connection is April 26 is Arbor Day, a connection to PALM TREES!? üå¥ @taylorswift13 look what your doing to us üòÇ pic.twitter.com/L4ucFuxCub<a href=# data-url=https://twitter.com/annasreputation/status/1099761837695029248 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>February 24, 2019</a></p><p>But wait, there's more! Fans are also pretty sure that Taylor gave a hint about the&nbsp;genre&nbsp;of her new album in that same palm tree picture and that she's already announced that the new album won't be country&nbsp;or&nbsp;pop (or at least not something that sounds like her previous iterations of country and pop). The evidence? There are seven trees in the picture, four on the left (representing Taylor's four country albums), two on the right (her two official pop albums) and one in the middle, standing alone (whatever genre #TS7 will be).&nbsp;</p><p>What's more, fans are speculating that Taylor has known that April 26 would be the release date for her seventh album (or at least something significant) for two years:</p><p>Taylor is also leaning heavily into butterfly iconography in the buildup to whatever is happening on April 26, marking a stark departure from the snake-filled&nbsp;Reputation&nbsp;era and giving a pretty clear signal that rebirth and transformation will figure heavily into the new...whatever it is we're getting in 13 days.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>People : "what's in your mind?"
