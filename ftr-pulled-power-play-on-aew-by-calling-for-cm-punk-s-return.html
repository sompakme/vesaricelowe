FTR is still on Punk’s side and they want a big tag team match in Wembley Stadium against The Elite at All In London, but it doesn’t seem like that is on AEW’s agenda.</p><p><a href=#>Click here for our complete coverage of AEW Dynamite this week.</a></p><p>During<a href=#> Wrestling Observer Radio</a>, Dave Meltzer spoke about this situation. It seems that AEW has no plan to make CM Punk and FTR vs The Elite happen. A very good piece of evidence to support this is the fact that Dax Harwood was permitted to speak on this in the first place.</p><p>Obviously, today that match is not taking place, because if it was FTR wouldn’t be talking about it, they would be quiet about it, because they would want to surprise people with the angle. So, the fact that they are talking about it tells you that there’s no surprise to the angle so it’s not gonna happen.</p><p>So, now it’s a matter of public support, because you know, it’s a funny thing because it’s like you’re trying to make amends in theory, but you’re really trying to not make amends in reality. You can see that this is a power plan in the sense of ‘we’re gonna show that we’re talking about it that we’re the professionals.'”</p><p>It was also noted that <a href=#>The Elite are not on board to work with CM Punk.</a> Meltzer then noted that it is like a “game” because “I wanna work with them, but they don’t wanna work with me.”</p><p>CM Punk has not made his return to AEW just yet, but a report came out yesterday saying that he has pitched a few ideas for his return to the company. That being said, Punk responded with <a href=#>a couple Instagram stories</a> that seemed to take a shot at that report.</p><p>We’ll have to see if CM Punk ever makes his way back to AEW. Odds are, it will take a lot of strategy, because Tony Khan also doesn’t want to upset a locker room full of talent who don’t want to see him return.</p><p>What’s your take on the CM Punk situation in AEW? Do you think he’s gearing up for an AEW return?
