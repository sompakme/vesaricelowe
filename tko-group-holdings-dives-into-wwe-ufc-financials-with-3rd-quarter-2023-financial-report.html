Now, we are getting our first glimpse on how the new publicly traded company is doing.</p><p>The new report noted that the new TKO company had a revenue of $449.1 million in the 3rd quarter of 2023. They also pulled in a net income of $22 million.</p><p>The new TKO Holdings Group company has a lot of aspects that they can brag out. They are just getting started with this new venture, but both UFC and WWE have held several events that brought a ton of money.</p><p>It was noted in the report that the UFC ran 13 events with strong viewership and attendance numbers. This set all-time revenue records in the process. On the other hand, the report boasted that WWE is entering into a five-year deal with NBC/Universal for SmackDown, which will start in October 2024.</p><p>Brandon Thurston broke down the numbers a bit as he posted on X. The timing of WWE and UFC’s merger played into things a bit this time around.</p><p>Because of the timing of the merger, which closed on September 12, the TKO results include UFC for the full 3 months but WWE only for the last 18 days of the quarter, which at least I wasn’t expecting, and there’s probably a convoluted accounting explanation for. WWE Jul 1 to Sep 11 is being reported separately.</p><p>So for Q3 revenue, TKO recorded $449.1M.</p><p>UFC: $397.5M</p><p>WWE (Sep 12-30): $51.6M</p><p>But for the entire 3-month period, WWE generated $287.3M.</p><p>The report also gave love to WrestleMania 40, which will go down in April 2024. They have sold over 90,000 tickets for the two-day event so far.</p><p>We will have to see if there are more interesting aspects of the 3rd quarter financial report as the numbers are broken down. At this point, WWE and UFC seem to have pulled off a successful merger.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What’s your take on WWE and UFC’s merger?

Years of experience in writing, journalism, and digging exclusive insider info for Ringside News. Worked in finance before realizing pro wrestling journalism made much less sense. Pro beachballs at pro wrestling shows, pro dives if someone catches, anti bullies, olives, and pineapples on pizza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX90e5BqZmlvX6m4sHnGq6auqF2dvK2wyKeerGWUnsOmv4yipa2nXazEpnnUn5pmnpmjrq%2BvyJqjrGWnnsGpeZKrm2appZa%2FtbHRZmlpamNis6q6wKeaopmcYr%2BmvM6rq2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
