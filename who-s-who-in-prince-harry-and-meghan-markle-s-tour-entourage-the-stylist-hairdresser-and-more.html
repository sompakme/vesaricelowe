And despite the tour being all about Harry and Meghan, and the Duchess' baby bump, attention has been on a number of other friendly faces too.

According to, she handed in her notice last year, but agreed to stay after she was offered her new position. Originally from Australia, Samantha joined the Buckingham Palace communications office in 2001. She worked in civil service and public relations before joining the royals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/132cb13df502-amy-pickerill-meghan-markle-a.jpg><h2>Amy Pickerill – Assistant Private Secretary</h2><p id=eGQo4tSvNAew>Amy has been working as <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Meghan's private assistant secretary</a></strong> since February 2018. She was formerly Prince William, Kate and Prince Harry's senior communications officer, but Harry reportedly handpicked her from his office to be his wife's first assistant private secretary. Her role includes everything from organising Meghan's schedule to making sure she is briefed before every engagement, plus collecting flowers and gifts during walkabouts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/684ea82a05f7-ben-and-jessica-mulroney-with-meghan-markle-a.jpg><h2>Jessica Mulroney - Meghan's stylist</h2><p id=eXnz5dJmQLQ_>Jessica Mulroney and her husband Ben touched down in Sydney shortly after Harry and Meghan. The stylist, who was flying from Toronto, has been on hand to help Meghan dress her growing baby bump. She's been best friends with the Duchess since Meghan's days acting on , and also worked as her stylist back then. Jessica is joining the royals in an unofficial capacity and is paying for her own expenses, therefore she is not part of the official tour entourage.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5f62fdd3e55b-george-northwood-hairdresser-a.jpg><h2>A hairdresser</h2><p id=euIgOujHOdsW>Meghan's trusted hairdresser George Northwood is also on tour. George, who tended to Meghan's locks for <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>her wedding reception</a></strong>, will make sure the Duchess is preened to perfection for every engagement. The hairstylist is being paid for privately.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6191cd3f026a-meghan-markle-and-amy-pickerill-a.jpg><h2>A Personal Assistant</h2><p id=eltg0YFCxBKv>Harry and Meghan have also been joined by a Personal Assistant, who will help with the organisation of each engagement. The royals are carrying out no fewer than 76, so there will be lots to do! Here, Meghan is pictured with her&nbsp;Assistant Private Secretary Amy Pickerill on tour in Ireland.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/eea9596f49c4-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-airport-a.jpg><h2>Four members of the Royal Communications Team</h2><p id=egHW1g9tfEb->Harry and Meghan have a large communications team, but they have been joined by four communications officers on their tour, including a digital communications manager and a programme coordinator.
