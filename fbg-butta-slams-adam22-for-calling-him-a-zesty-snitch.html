He also said that he had a lengthy conversation with Butta recently, which saw him swear that he's an honest person. Adam <a href=# rel>appears to be confused</a> by the entire situation, calling FBG Butta some kind of "sociopathic liar" and advising others not to believe a word he says.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Crip Mac Speaks On Adam22 Altercation</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fbg-butta-s-response-to-adam22>FBG Butta's Response To Adam22</h2></span><p>FBG Butta fired back shortly after Adam shared his take. According to him, he has receipts to prove he "scammed" No Jumper, despite the internet personality's claims. He turned the tables on him, accusing him of being the one lying about the situation. It's unclear when Butta plans to drop the receipts, however, fans are eagerly awaiting them. Unfortunately, this is <a href=# rel>far from the first beef</a> Adam22's gotten wrapped up in as of late. Last week, Shoebox Baby called him out for mentioning him during his interview with Sidney Starr, claiming that he'd rather he stop speaking on him altogether.</p><p><a href=# rel>"Don't put my name in none of that s**t, gang,"</a> Shoebox Baby told Adam. "If it got something to do with some punk s**t, some b***h s**t, some snitch s**t, don't say my name with that s**t. I know it be all fun and games, but don't be playing like that, man."
