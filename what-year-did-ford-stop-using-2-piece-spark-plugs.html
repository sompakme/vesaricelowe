When it comes to Ford 4.6 spark plug difficulties, the F-Series had a particularly difficult time throughout the years 2004 through 2008. Similarly, Ford 5.4 spark plug issues have been reported on a number of other models from these years.</p><p></p><h3>What year did Ford finally resolve the spark plug issue with the v10?</h3><p>Problems with the Ford v10’s spark plugs Model years 1999-2004 are covered by this TSB, which includes both the V8 and V10 engines.

The fuel economy was the same as before, with an EPA rating of 15 for city driving and 22 for highway driving (as per current EPA methods).</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What is the frequency with which spark plugs fail?</h3><p>It is often publicised by vehicle manufacturers that their vehicles are equipped with extended-life spark plugs that can maintain a perfect spacing for up to 100,000 miles.
