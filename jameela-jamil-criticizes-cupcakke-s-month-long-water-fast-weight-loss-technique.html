This user seems to be&nbsp;expressing&nbsp;that Jameela, as a non-black woman, should not be coming after a black woman's health choices in such a manner because the actress cannot understand the different struggles black women face when it comes to their bodies. The user went on to say that "If C*pc*kKe were a White woman, this convo would look different."</p><p>Jameela Jamil Criticizes Cupcakke's "Month-Long Water Fast" Weight Loss Technique</p><p><h6>Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Glamour</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Jameela later retracted her initial statements, tweeting: "This goes beyond not just being so careless as to quote tweet someone whose context and life you're unaware of. But also, being extra careful to not pile on to Black women, who are already piled onto, ignored and policed the most. I hear all the criticism. I see my f**k up." She followed this with: "I know I there’s more work to do, and in particular on this discussion of eating disorders and body expectations of BW, I will work to bring more light to this conversation from this community."</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Staff Writer&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Originally from Vancouver, Lynn Sharpe is a Montreal-based writer for HNHH.
