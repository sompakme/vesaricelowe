<a href=#>interest rate</a> to 24.75% from 22.75%, which it said was to tackle high inflation.</p><p class=align-left>However, Nigeria's inflation rate raced to 33.2% in March, with <a href=#>food inflation </a>hitting 40.01%, a yearly increase of 15.56 percentage points from 24.45% recorded in March 2023.</p><p class=align-left>The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said the rising prices of items such as garri, millet, yam tuber, water yam, and others could cause the surge in food inflation.</p><p class=align-left>The Nigerian government approved N5 billion for each state and the Federal Capital Territory following the removal of petrol subsidy to enable them to purchase food items for distribution to <a href=#>people</a> experiencing poverty.</p><p class=align-left>The CBN governor noted that inflationary pressure had failed to thaw despite the rise in interest rates in February.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px

FX market, which results from decisions made at the MPC meeting.</p><p class=align-left>Punch reports that the CBN boss further said that the fiscal authorities better handled the new sources of inflation to complement monetary policy efforts.</p><p class=align-left>Bala Bello, another MPC member, said both food and core inflation increased in February 2024, underpinning the rise in headline inflation to 31.70% from 29.90% in the previous month.</p><p class=align-left>"Inflation is currently unacceptably high and requires decisive and coordinated efforts to curb it, given its adverse impact on citizens' purchasing power, investment decisions and broad output performance," he said.</p><p class=align-left>Bala stated that the federal government's programmes addressing food insecurity, such as releasing grains from the strategic reserves, distributing seeds and fertilisers, and supporting dry-season farming, are essential and commendable.</p><h2>CBN fintech to suspend
