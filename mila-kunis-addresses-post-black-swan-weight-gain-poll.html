So she’s thrilled to have gained some weight back — which is something you never ever hear an actress say. Ever. 
“Flat, flat, flat,” the actress, 28, says of her skinny Swan figure in thenew issue of Glamour. “There was no shape, no form, nothing, nothing. God, I’m probably 25 pounds heavier in muscle mass and weight at this point."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I didn’t do it because I had issues. Now this is my normal weight that I started out with.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>PHOTOS: 28 of Summer’s Most Anticipated Movies: ‘Avengers,’ ‘Dark Knight,’ ‘Prometheus’</a></strong></p><p>One has to wonder what Dior thinks of her weight gain. She and her Black Swan costar <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_natalie-portman data-tag=natalie-portman>Natalie Portman</a></strong> are both brand ambassadors for the couture house; Kunis appears in Miss Dior handbag ads and Portman is the face of one of Dior’s fragrances, Miss Dior Cheri. To fit into a designer sample size, she has to be a size 2. But to be honest, we can’t really tell much difference between her skinny figure and fuller one.&nbsp;</p><p>Kunis’ new movie, <a href=# id=auto-tag_ted data-tag=ted>Ted</a>, directed and co-written by <a href=# id=auto-tag_family-guy data-tag=family-guy>Family Guy</a> creator <strong>Seth MacFarlane</strong> and co-starring <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_mark-wahlberg data-tag=mark-wahlberg>Mark Wahlberg</a></strong>, is now in theaters. And she’s also got a slate of new films, Tar, Hell and Back, and Oz: The Great and Powerful, (all in post production) and Blood Ties (currently filming) due out soon.</p><p>Meanwhile, the single actress, who’s rumored to be dating <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_ashton-kutcher data-tag=ashton-kutcher>Ashton Kutcher</a></strong>, says she would use an online dating site – if she weren’t in the limelight.</p><p>“If I didn’t do what I do, I would do Internet dating instead of going out to bars. In two seconds I would. It makes so much more sense,” she admitted, explaining that a good friend met her fiance on one and her gal pals love to troll the looking-for-love sites.</p><p>“It’s online shopping! We all get together with our laptops and have a glass of wine. Then we message the guy.”</p><p>(Given her recent cell phone hacking and stalker problems, we certainly hope she’s being careful on the Internet.)</p><p>Tell us: What do you think of Mila’s skinny vs. normal weight appearance?</p><p></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvSrbClnV%2Bitq2tjKSsp6GjYq6lsNGeqqydo2K9sL%2FTZpmlmZOgerTDwKdksJ2ZnLW1ecaaoKdloKS5rXmSbWpucGZk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
