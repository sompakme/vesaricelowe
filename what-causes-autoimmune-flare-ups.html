One theory is that some microorganisms (such as bacteria or viruses) or drugs may trigger changes that confuse the immune system. This may happen more often in people who have genes that make them more prone to autoimmune disorders.<h2>What are markers for autoimmune disease?</h2>Antinuclear antibodies are markers for a number of autoimmune diseases, the most notable of which is systemic lupus erythematosus (Ferrell and Tan, 1985). Antibodies to specific nuclear constituents are high specific for certain collagen vascular diseases.<h2>How does Covid affect autoimmune disease?</h2>The virus that causes COVID-19 can cause intense infection and inflammation in the body. This can place more stress on the body of people who live with other health conditions such as autoimmune disorders.<h2>Does autoimmune disease make you more likely to get sick?</h2>People with autoimmune disorders have been described as the population at the most risk of catching diseases. This is due to the way the different autoimmune disorders affect their immune system, and more importantly, to the immunosuppressant drugs used to treat most of these diseases.<h2>Can Covid trigger autoimmune disease?</h2>Widespread and long-term inflammation during severe COVID-19 may cause the immune system to produce antibodies to pieces of the virus it wouldn't normally recognize.

A possible explanation for this is the expansion of many protective regulatory mechanisms highly characteristic in the elderly. Of note is the higher production of peripheral T-regulatory cells.<h2>Does sleep help autoimmune disease?</h2>Chronic insomnia is associated with an increased incidence of developing autoimmune disease (176). Findings in animal model of systemic lupus erythematosus also suggest that sleep deprivation could be involved in the etiology of the disease (177).<h2>Are you born with autoimmune diseases?</h2>It is difficult to suggest which risk factors place you at the greatest risk of an autoimmune disease.
