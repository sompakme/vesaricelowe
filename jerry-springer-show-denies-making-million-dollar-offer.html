She said, “I did not say she was innocent. I just said there was not enough evidence. If you cannot prove what the crime was, you cannot determine what the punishment should be.”</p><p>ABC News says it did not pay for the interview with Ford or Baez. A meter reader who stumbled upon Caylee’s remains testified that the organization did, however, pay him $15,000 for a photo of a snake in exchange for his interview. The news division also paid Anthony $200,000 in 2008 to license photos.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKSt0p6wZpmeqbWwuthmq6uhkaF6q7HRq7Bmq6Cntq%2BzxKtka2hpZ4R3ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
