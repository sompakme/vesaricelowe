And while the physical manifestation of the ailment may be unpleasant, luckily it's rarely ever fatal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of symptoms, most tend to be similar to those of smallpox, but are usually milder.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Monkeypox will start with systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, malaise, headache, joint pain, and swollen lymph nodes," explains Dr. David. "These symptoms will last for one to two days before the rash develops."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-prevent-monkeypox></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Prevent Monkeypox</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thankfully, the smallpox vaccine is effective in preventing the monkeypox virus — the only problem is that it's mainly reserved for those <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>who meet certain criteria</a> in most areas. However, there are ways to minimize exposure to the virus.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to board-certified dermatologist and founder of SkinClusive Dermatology <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Adeline Kikam</a>, DO, MS, FAAD, your best bet is to avoid the following:</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Prolonged direct or skin-to-skin contact of an infected person.</strong> "The lesions of monkey pox are highly contagious," she notes.</li><li><strong>Sustained exposure to respiratory droplets, especially face-to-face contact.</strong></li><li><strong>Sharing personal items such as bedding, towels, utensils, and clothing.</strong></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"No kissing, touching, hugging, or sexual contact with anyone infected with monkeypox," she adds.

So, if you know you're going to be easily bothered by the images ahead, now's the time to either close this tab or close your eyes as your scroll down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">OK, for those of you that are still with us, you ready?</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Depending on your skin tone and which stage the lesions are at, the bumps and subsequent scabs will have a different look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Many people will first develop a blister in their mouth followed by a punch of flat pink or tan lesions on their face, body, and arms," explains Dr. David. "In one to two days these flat lesions will fill with clear liquid and form blisters and then the fluid will turn white pus-filled bumps. After a week, the pus bumps will scab over and eventually fall off and heal over."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Here's How to Properly Apply Concealer</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-i-take-care-of-my-skin-if-i-get-monkeypox></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do I Take Care of My Skin If I Get Monkeypox?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Being soft, patient, and gentle is the key. So as you bathe or apply lotion to your body, it's important to remember that the lesions are very contagious — so you'll want to avoid friction at all costs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Washing with fragrance-free Dove body wash and washing clothes with <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Arm and Hammer Sensitive Skin detergent</a> are great starts," explains Dr. David. "Soothing topical products include petrolatum products, like Aquaphor, Vaniply Ointment, or Vaseline. And you should make sure to apply hydrating humectants with ceramides, aloe, and/or hyaluronic acid as ingredients. Oatmeal baths are also very soothing. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Aveeno makes convenient oatmeal bath packets</a> you can add to a full tub of warm water."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Kikam agrees that warm baths are best. She also suggests taking an anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen if the bumps are painful or tender.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Use a q-tip to apply over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream twice daily to help with inflammation," she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also, while it may be tempting for some, do <strong>not</strong> pop or pick at the lesions as this will contribute to scarring. However, if one bursts on its own, make sure to treat it right away.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Wipe off any puss with a clean wet towel or tissue very gently," Dr. Kikam suggests. "If the sore is open and isolated, you can put a bandage over to avoid picking and exposure to infection."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-will-monkeypox-lesions-scar--and-how-do-i-prevent-this></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Will Monkeypox Lesions Scar — and How Do I Prevent This?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There is definitely the risk of scarring, but thankfully there are also ways to prevent it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First off, you want to make sure you avoid exfoliation as well as popping, picking, or squeezing any active lesions. This can contribute to inflammation, which then leads to scars.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The most notable type of scaring associated with monkeypox is atrophic scarring where you have indentations in the skin post monkeypox lesions," explains Dr. Kikam "It's the result of inflammation that causes focally reduced collagen production. Atrophic scars may improve with time in some people depending on the extent and size of the defect, but it'll be a large and permanent scar without dermatologic intervention."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, Dr. Davis adds that hypertrophic or keloidal scars can occur and are most common among people of color.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-way-to-treat-the-appearance-of-monkeypox-scars></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Best Way to Treat the Appearance of Monkeypox Scars?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Kikam, there are a plethora of ways to treat scarring from monkeypox. But it's best to speak to a dermatologist — who can help you customize a treatment plan — before applying anything to the skin or undergoing any at-home or in-office treatments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Chemical peels, microdermabrasion, microneedling, laser resurfacing, and even dermal fillers for atrophic scars [can be effective]," she notes. "However, as part of one's routine, sunscreen, the use of anti-discoloration products to target hyperpigmentation, and retinol to stimulate collagen product is advisable."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1opKimm5rGsbvXZqmaq5hir7a5z6xkrJuRp7%2BqusZmqqikpam2sLrS</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
