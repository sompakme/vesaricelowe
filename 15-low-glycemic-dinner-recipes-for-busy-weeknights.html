However, weeknight dinners don’t have to consume your evenings or derail your healthy eating. On these nights when it’s challenging to pause—and you’re low on energy or patience—use this guide to make a quick and healthy low-glycemic dinner.&nbsp;</p><p>The following low <a href=#>glycemic index</a> (GI) recipes don’t contain many refined carbs or sugar and provide simple suggestions for a low GI meal plan when you just can’t stomach the idea of high-effort meals.</p><p>{{mid-cta}}</p><h2>Why Low-Glycemic Foods and Meals Matter</h2><p>Low-glycemic meals aren’t necessarily low-carb, but eating low-GI foods can help regulate insulin levels and avoid spikes in your blood sugar.1 This is important because the excess glucose not used by your body as energy can be stored as fat.2 Stable blood glucose levels after eating are good for weight loss and weight regulation. Keeping your blood sugar stable can also improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of dementia.3</p><p>Frequently eating high-GI foods may lead to higher risk factors for obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), heart disease, and inflammation.4 High-GI foods include simple carbohydrates, such as sugar, honey, and corn syrup, and processed carbohydrates, like crackers and bread.</p><h2>Tips to Build Healthy, Low-Glycemic Dinners and Meals</h2><p>Simple, low-glycemic dinner ideas can be full of nutrients and flavor. Keep these guidelines in mind when planning healthy, low-glycemic recipes for dinner:</p><ul role=list><li>Plan your meals at the beginning of the week so you know what ingredients you need on hand.</li><li>Meal prep earlier in the week for the nights you will not have time to cook.</li><li>Fill half your plate with vegetables at each meal (more about <a href=#>low-glycemic vegetables</a>).</li><li>Eat lean proteins, including seafood and poultry.</li><li>Choose sauces, dressings, and seasonings wisely, as many are packed with sugar, high fructose corn syrup, other refined carbs, sodium, and unhealthy seed oils.</li><li>When it comes to grains, make them whole and try to choose minimally processed grains such as <a href=#>quinoa</a> and barley.</li><li>Skip the low-fat foods where fat is often just replaced with extra sugar. Instead, find natural versions of these ingredients or swap them with whole foods.</li></ul><p>It’s important to remember that no two bodies are the same, and the impact that foods have on blood glucose levels will vary between individuals. A registered dietitian nutritionist can help you navigate the <a href=#>science behind the low-glycemic diet</a> and design a meal plan that fits your individualized nutrition needs.</p><p>&lt;p class="pro-tip">&lt;strong><strong>Learn More: </strong>&lt;/strong>&lt;a href="low-glycemic-breakfast">8 Low Glycemic Breakfast Ideas You’ll Love!&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></p><h2>15 Low-Glycemic Dinner Recipes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-global.website-files.com/63ed08484c069d0492f5b0bc/65c3d707bbfbe5f57ef7aacd_65c3cc829451a750ae2f7bbe_chickpea-hummus.webp><p>You might choose a low-glycemic diet to <a href=#>lose weight</a>, reduce your risk of developing diabetes, or better manage your diabetes.
