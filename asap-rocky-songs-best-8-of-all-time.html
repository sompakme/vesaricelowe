Beginning his career as a part of <a href=# rel>the A$AP Mob</a>, the Harlem-based prospect first blew up after releasing "Peso" in summer 2011. Two years prior, Rocky described being a young man in Harlem involved in the streets and the fashion world. He began making songs along with his childhood friends with the goal of getting them out of their unsustainable lifestyle.</p><p>Approaching five years since his last studio release, fans are beginning to wonder when we'll be hearing his next studio album. He <a href=# rel>released "Same Problems?"</a> in January while rumors have been circulating that the track launches the rollout for Don't Be Dumb -- the rumored title of his next project. However, we haven't heard anything from Rocky in the three months since. "Same Problems?" was one of his most introspective cuts to date, with euphoric synths wearing the influences of <a href=# class=text-word rel>Kid Cudi</a>. Before the anticipated rollout of his next album, we figured we'd take a look at the 7 best songs in ASAP Rocky's catalog.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-praise-the-lord-da-shine-2018>8. "Praise The Lord (Da Shine)" (2018)</h2></span><p>Featuring <a href=# rel>British MC Skepta</a>, "Praise The Lord" is ASAP Rocky's most commercially successful song to date. The Skepta-assisted record serves as the third single <a href=# rel>off of Testing</a>. It marked the third collaboration between the two artists. In an interview with Genius, Rocky discussed "smoking in the studio" with Skepta when he first heard the beat. Similar to tracks such as "Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye 2," Rocky is reflecting on his massive success. He states, "Locked and loaded, diamonds glowin'/ chart-climbing on 'em." In addition, Rocky provides motivation to think outside of the box no matter their circumstances. He gives a shoutout to people with the "game plan" and "escape plans," urging them to "create, explore, expand, [and] conquer."</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-sundress-2018>7. "Sundress" (2018)</h2></span><p>"Sundress" represented a sharp turn in Rocky's career, for the better. Produced by Kevin Parker (predominantly <a href=# rel>known as Tame Impala</a>), the track came from left field compared to the grimy bangers that Rocky's released in the past. A psychedelic blend of indie-rock and hip-hop, fans have been hoping he'll release a full project that parallels this sound ever since. In fact, this might be the case with his new project. "Same Problems?" is far more melodic, making it relatively similar to "Sundress."</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-peso-2011>6. "Peso" (2011)</h2></span><p>"Peso" put ASAP Rocky on the map. The lead single <a href=# rel>for Live.Love.A$AP</a>, the track transcended Rocky from the streets of Harlem and into the limelight. He told the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">New York Times</a>, "New York didn't respect me until 'Peso.'" Even though he was very much focused on breaking out, he didn't use this as an excuse to formulate a generic sound. Right off the bat, Rocky aspired to push the boundaries in hip-hop. "Peso" is a song that very much mirrors the environment that ASAP Rocky grew up In. He captured Harlem's flamboyant essence with fashion-forward bars, along with an analysis of capturing the flamboyant essence of Harlem.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-lord-pretty-flacko-jodye-2-2015>5. "Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye 2" (2015)</h2></span><p>"Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye 2" is a definitive banger of the past decade. Featuring paranoia-inducing synths and menacing bass, Nez & Rio come through with a simplistic approach to the overall production. However, Rocky rides the beat with high-energy and technical proficiency. Still, the brief runtime of the records left fans wishing for an extended version. An anthem through and through, Rocky portrays himself atop the mountain of MCs.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-r-cali-2013>4. "r - Cali" (2013)</h2></span><p>Created for Grand Theft Auto V, "r - Cali" provided ASAP Rocky with his first opportunity to create a song specifically for a video game. Anyone who knows Grand Theft Auto will know that the soundtracks are a hallmark aspect of the franchise. "r - Cali" would become one of the most well-known songs in GTAV, perfectly fitting the fictional Los Santos setting.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-holy-ghost-2015>3. "Holy Ghost" (2015)</h2></span><p>One of ASAP Rocky's more underrated songs, "Holy Ghost" is the intro of AT.LONG.LAST.A$AP. In the song, Rocky details his hesitancy towards organized religion while also reflecting on his own spirituality. At the same time, he's pleading for his corrupted soul to be saved. It's one of his more narratively damning songs to date. The melancholy guitar strings add a unique element to "Holy Ghost," thanks to DJ Khalil and Danger Mouse's production.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-f-kin-problems-2012>2. "F**kin' Problems" (2012)</h2></span><p>"F**kin' Problems" is an <a href=# rel>iconic track</a> in Rocky's catalog. Featuring <a href=# class=text-word rel>Drake</a>, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Kendrick Lamar</a>, and <a href=# class=text-word rel>2 Chainz</a>, the headlining heavy hitters in rap came together for a generational anthem. ASAP Rocky cedes much of the song to his contemporaries, solely delivering one verse on the front end. However, his ability to stand his ground with Drake and Kendrick solidified him as one of the most talented MCs out of his generation.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-canal-st-2015>1. "Canal St." (2015)</h2></span><p>"Canal St." contains one of the best beats that ASAP Rocky has ever flowed on, thanks to the sample of Bones' "Dirt." Canal Street is a famous crosstown street in Lower Manhattan, New York City. Best-known for its expression of the arts and spots such as Chinatown, Rocky claims to have copped two of his gold chains from Canal Street. In fact, he's referenced the street multiple times in other songs. Rocky's relationship with Canal Street likely changed significantly throughout his life. Once a place where he couldn't afford anything, he now walks down the street as the wealthiest person there. He references this on the track, stating, "I went from roaches on my bump to red brooches on the cuff of my tux."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaoVxhJhmmKyZoGK%2FsK%2FKsmSsp56cwA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
