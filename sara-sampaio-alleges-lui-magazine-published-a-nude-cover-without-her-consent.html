Sampaio added that she plans to take legal action against the magazine with the help of her agency and lawyer. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://people.com/style/sara-sampaio-lui-magazine-topless-cover-controversy/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a> reached out to Lui for a comment, but the magazine has not yet responded.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Even with the 'No Nudity' clause in my agreement with Lui, I was aggressively pressured to do nude shots on set, asking me why I didn't want to show my nipples or go fully nude," 26-year-old Sampaio shared in an Instagram post.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Throughout the shoot day, I needed to constantly defend myself and reiterate my boundaries with no nude images, making sure I covered myself as best as I could," she added.</p><img alt="Hair, Fashion model, Face, Lip, Fashion, Skin, Eyebrow, Hairstyle, Beauty, Haute couture, " title="Hair, Fashion model, Face, Lip, Fashion, Skin, Eyebrow, Hairstyle, Beauty, Haute couture, " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-sara-sampaio-1-1508452859.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When she saw the photos taken, she noticed there were "accidental exposures with parts of my body I didn't want exposed," she continued. Sampaio says she told the magazine she didn't want those photos used.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The photo Lui ultimately used featured Sampaio wearing panties, no top, and a coat that was positioned so it revealed one of her nipples.<span></span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Like so many models, I've had negative experiences in the past where I felt pressured to pose nude," she wrote, saying she'd been coerced by photographers or stylists who have seen her pose nude in the past. "I was bullied," she added.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The model added that she's "selective" when it comes to being exposed during photoshoots. "Just because I've consented to posing nude in the past, it does not give anyone the permission to assume I would do it again under any circumstance," she said.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I feel violated, mistreated, and disrespected as a professional and as a woman."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"What they did to me is unacceptable.

"I want to do what I can to prevent this from happening to me again, and to others."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She concluded saying this kind of "bullying and abuse" is "systemic" in the modeling world, echoing '90s supermodel Christy Turlington Burns, who recently told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://wwd.com/eye/people/christy-turlington-burns-harassment-mistreatment-has-always-been-tolerated-in-fashion-industry-11029412/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=WWD class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">WWD</a> that "harassment and mistreatment have been widely known and tolerated in the industry."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Sadly, this is not an isolated incident, and I am not alone," Sampaio wrote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The model tagged her revealing post with #MyJobShouldNotIncludeAbuse, a hashtag created by model <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/cameronrussell/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cameron Russell" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Cameron Russell</a>, who's been sharing anonymous stories of sexual harassment in the modeling industry on her Instagram profile.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Flip through below to see Sampaio's full statement on Instagram.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
