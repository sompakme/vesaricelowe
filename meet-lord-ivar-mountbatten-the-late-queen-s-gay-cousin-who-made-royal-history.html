Ivar told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">The Daily Mail</a>: "Ultimately, Penny did not feel sufficiently loved and she wanted more from a husband than she could get from me. Given my sexuality, I was quite surprised she married me in the first place. It was brave. Perhaps she thought she could change me but in the end she realised she couldn't."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0391e683f8a9-snapinstaapp1059460851069821843226744262492039151668320n1024.jpg><h2 lang=en-us>Children&nbsp;</h2><p id=eas6yBbGoQP data-wc=34>Ivar shares three daughters with Penny: Ella, Louise and Alix.

When I was growing up, it was known as 'the love that dare not speak its name', but what's amazing now is how far we have all come in terms of acceptance.&nbsp;</p><p id=eloqMkCcvbtH data-wc=50>"'Coming out' is such a funny phrase but it's what I suppose I did in a rather roundabout way, emerging to a place I'm happy to be.

James said: "He doesn't hang around, and that's the delightful thing about Ivar, he makes his mind up about some­thing and sticks to it. There's no game playing, to a degree where you're almost looking for the catch. He's so straightforward and remarkably easy to love."&nbsp;</p><p id=eFLYWzW1RsyI data-wc=12>Ivar proposed to James in the kitchen of their home, Bridwell Manor.&nbsp;</p><h2 lang=en-us>The wedding&nbsp;</h2><p id=ePkqJabx-5Xl data-wc=31>In 2018, James and Ivar wed in a ceremony in Devon, and the royal was given away by his first wife Penny, who has been supportive throughout his coming out journey.&nbsp;</p><p id=eR8HqucQwBJj data-wc=58>On Instagram, Ivar wrote: "Well we did it finally! It was an amazing day despite the miserable British weather. Fabulous service conducted by Trish Harrogate, chief Registrar for Devon, who set the perfect but lighthearted tone for what is a serious occasion." He also thanked the gospel choir, the Bristol’s Teachers Rock Choir as well as the photographer.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/03105b8cd4fd-snapinstaapp4193840511392623462310484709592624600621930n1024-1.jpg><p id=ekDJOB9SqXiS data-wc=39>He went on: "Most importantly a massive thanks to my three gorgeous girls for being so understanding and supportive, without their support this could never have happened!

He said: "Having the world’s press shine a huge spotlight on me overnight proclaiming me 'The First Gay Royal' was nonetheless pretty alarming. The reaction of my friends and family concerned me a lot, and I wondered if my world would suddenly collapse around me.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLQonHh_JsiH data-wc=58>"My fears were of course unfounded. Absolutely everyone was incredibly supportive, and it soon became clear that in the scheme of things, your sexuality is of no significance to others. In my case, it’s fair to say that once I had made that very public leap out of the closet, I wondered what all the fuss was about."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f2a981fc00a7-snapinstaapp9601089011504668119736193471723584887397888n1080.jpg><h2 lang=en-us>Royal reaction&nbsp;</h2><p id=ejZ26tRS6CTU data-wc=64>While Prince William has not addressed the match directly, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>he said in 2019</a> when speaking to an LGBTQ+ charity in London that he would "fully support" his children if they were gay but added: "It does worry me from a parent point of view how many barriers, hateful words, persecution, all that and discrimination that might come, that's the bit that really troubles me." &nbsp;</p><p id=eyFRa8iB4aOu data-wc=22>The Queen's cousin told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Tatler</a> that <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Prince Edward</a> and <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Duchess Sophie</a> were "very supportive" of the match and thought James is "brilliant".&nbsp;</p><p id=efDAkQHjlyYn data-wc=31>He also added that his aunt Nadejda Mountbatten, 2nd Mar­chioness of Milford Haven, "was a lesbian", and said: "The older generation of my family have seen and done it all before."&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>LISTEN: Everything you need to know about Kate's appearance at Trooping the Colour</i></b></p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">LOVE THE ROYALS?
