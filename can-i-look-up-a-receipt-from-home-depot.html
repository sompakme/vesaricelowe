When that number appears in-store again, Home Depot recognises you as the owner and may use that information to send you an email.</p><p align=justify></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><b><span>What is the best way to see my purchase history?</span></b></h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p align=justify>On your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, you may see your purchase history.
