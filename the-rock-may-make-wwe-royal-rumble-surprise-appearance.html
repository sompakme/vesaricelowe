The Wrestling Observer Newsletter noted that WWE has batted around the idea of The Rock making a Royal Rumble entrance at the last minute to win the match. This was something they talked about in past years.
The idea of The Rock main eventing WrestleMania with Roman Reigns could give WWE a chance to dust off that idea."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Rock is not advertised for Tropicana Field, and it’s still not very likely, the possibility is still there.</p><p>“Punk and Rhodes are the obvious favorites to win, with Gunther, Knight and Rock following. The idea of Rock as a surprise Rumble entrant coming in late and winning was discussed for past years when there was an idea of him headlining Mania. So while nobody has advertised it and it probably wouldn’t happen, I wouldn’t reject it as a possibility. Obviously this is completely up to Dwayne Johnson. The usual protocol is that one world title challenger would win at the Rumble and the other at Elimination Chamber.”</p><p>The Rock could really shake up the WrestleMania landscape if he decides he can work the show of shows. A Royal Rumble return for the Great One would also certainly kick things off in a big way.</p><p>We will keep our eye on this story, and so much more, right here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a>. You never know what will happen in the future, but The Rock’s return is certainly in the rumor mill.</p><p>What’s your take on this situation with The Rock’s return?
