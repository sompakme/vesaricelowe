A new photo is circulating online, appearing to reveal a text message from a source claiming that she was brought into jail, and is facing multiple charges. Her charges seem to include cocaine possession with the intent to sell and disorderly conduct/ breach of peace.</p><p>The circumstances leading up to her alleged arrest and charges are unclear, however, the report has left many fans disappointed. She's also <a href=# rel>struggled with alcohol abuse</a> in the past, and has been accused of dabbling in other substances. In 2019, Jefferson was arrested and indicted on child abuse charges for allegedly physically attacking her middle school-aged daughter. She bonded out, later appearing in court for the case and getting arrested again for being drunk. Sources claimed at the time that <a href=# rel>the stress of the situation</a> had caused her to relapse, and that she had been working on becoming sober leading up to the court appearance.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Tommie Lee Net Worth 2023: A Sneak Peek Into Her Fortune</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tommie-lee-allegedly-arrested-in-miami>Tommie Lee Allegedly Arrested In Miami</h2></span><p>At the time, Jefferson took to Instagram to acknowledge the incident. She claimed that she had been <a href=# rel>working towards sobriety</a>, and was seeking treatment for her substance issues. “I’ve been working really hard through my problems considering the challenges that’s been set before me since I’ve been home,” she wrote.&nbsp;”I’ve done all that I can do on my own to shake my habits," she added. "I do realize that I need help and I am currently seeking treatment.”</p><p>Though her alcohol use was well-documented on Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta, Jefferson denied being an alcoholic in a <a href=# rel>2019 interview with HNHH</a>. She did admit to struggling with it, however, she claimed the label wasn't "fair." With that being said, it's also unconfirmed whether or not she was using anything at the time of her apparent arrest. Keep an eye on HNHH for more updates on Tommie Lee.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Tommie Lee Alleges Natalie Nunn Slept With Chris Brown</a></strong></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">[Via]</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnZYF1hZdmq6ilnZ6ybrjEnmSrnaCkv7Wxw6WwZpmip7K0wMSd</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
