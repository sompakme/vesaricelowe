As with all His Majesty’s recent engagements, his program in both countries will be subject to doctors’ advice, and any necessary modifications on health grounds.”</p><p>Hello reports that this visit will be the first trip Down Under by a reigning monarch since 2011, when Queen Elizabeth visited for what would be her final time. Charles and Camilla last visited Australia in 2018, when they represented Her late Majesty at the Commonwealth Games there.</p><p>Including travel time, the King and Queen will be away for 10 days—though the trip was originally intended to be closer to three weeks, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-cancer-cut-king-charles-royal-tour-short-you-cant-do-everything referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>The Daily Beast</u></a> reports.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dkpL4QJJftVvCfobwNsLbm-1920-80.jpg><p>“There has been a lot of debate in the Palace about how much Charles should be doing,” a source told the outlet. “There are plenty of people who think a long haul foreign tour is unwise when you have cancer. But ultimately the decisions are coming from the top, and the problem is he knows that if he doesn’t do a trip to Australia as King now, it will probably never happen.”</p><p>The trip is critical for the monarchy’s relationship with Australia, as the country “is a very important country to him,” a friend said. “It’s no secret that there are Republican rumblings Down Under, and he wants to do everything he can to keep the Aussies on board. But it’s clear he wouldn’t be going unless he was on the mend and his doctors thought he could handle it. It’s a hugely encouraging sign.”</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

He has been very open about having cancer. It is absolutely plain to see that he is doing really well. It’s very sad about New Zealand, but I think it’s just the reality of trying to work while being treated for cancer—you can’t do everything.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiqn66urb%2BOpKCnn12YtaK%2By56qZqmlmrKvecKapKKknJZ6sK%2FEmqWimV2pvLa%2BjKyfqKqkmrumsIyapKKcXZiur6%2FEq2SbmaSpuaZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
