Emily Austin, 21, broke onto the scene during the height of the pandemic when she interviewed NBA stars such as Enes Kanter, Carlos Boozer, and Mitchell Robinson.
But this wasn't a part of some long thought-out plan, but rather a snap decision to get away from heading down the wrong path."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So embarrassing.'"</p><p>The Instagram Lives, titled Daily Vibes with Emily Austin, were a hit, providing what she saw as "something light in the middle of the pandemic."</p><p>These videos proved the launch pad for her career, with producers watching them live and reaching out about potential gigs.</p><p>She explained: "After Ennis and Mitch I remember producers would start watching my Instagram Lives because one day a producer was like 'Hi, I worked with MTV for five years, I worked here for five years, I really want you to audition for this new music series coming out to interview some of the worlds most famous artists. How old are you?'</p><p>"I was like '18' - now I'd just turned 18 - and they were like 'never mind you're not going to make it.' And I was like 'No let me audition please,' and they were like 'no you're too young.'<br>I was like 'then who cares? Let me get rejected.'</p><p>"So I auditioned, and I made it."</p><p>The "domino effect," as she described it, really picked up its momentum here.</p><p>Before long, she had signed a Puma sponsorship and was working for Sports Illustrated, as a host for&nbsp;<a href=#>boxing</a>&nbsp;events including Battle of the Platforms, Social Gloves, and the all-<a href=#>NFL</a>&nbsp;matchup between Adrian Peterson and Le'Veon Bell.</p><p>She also covered the&nbsp;<a href=#>NBA</a>&nbsp;Summer League, interviewing players like Josh Giddey, Scottie Pippen Jr., and Shareef O'Neal.</p><p>Speaking to these players each comes with their own highlights.</p><p>Kanter shared "about all that was going on with Turkey," while O'Neal explained how "when Shareef had open heart surgery himself, Kobe (Bryant) would come visit him every day."</p><p>Next in line for Austin is <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.the-sun.com/sport/7164075/miss-universe-star-emily-austin-teases-career-move/>her own show with The Game Day called Hoop Chat with Emily Austin.</a></p><p>She told The U.S. Sun that this will "be my first show where I'm literally sitting down and just talking hoops.</p><p>"It's not gonna be a 30-minute interview, maybe a five-minute interview. It's whoever comes on, talking some gossip, or this player was outstanding this week."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>But her career has already gone far beyond just the sports world, as she is also an activist and an advisor to the&nbsp;<a href=#>United Nations</a>' Israeli delegation.</p><p>Meanwhile, Austin also recently traveled to New Orleans, Louisiana where&nbsp;<a href=#>she was one of the judges at the 71st Miss Universe pageant</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/miss-universe-star-emily-austin-789418534-3.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/NINTCHDBPICT000788471744-3.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK570qmmq6xfbH54gZdqa2idnZ65unnArqqtoZ5isKK%2BxJ6pZqqVq7KtrdOipqdlo6G2pbXNoGSnmpFiva2t2J6prGWUosBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
