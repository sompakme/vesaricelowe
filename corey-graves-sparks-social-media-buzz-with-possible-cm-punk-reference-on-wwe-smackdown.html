However, it wasn’t the match announcements that grabbed everyone’s attention but a cryptic message delivered by Corey Graves.</p><p>As the graphics for the Seth Rollins vs. Shinsuke Nakamura match appeared on the screen, Graves uttered a line that sent shockwaves through the wrestling community: “The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was making the world forget that he existed.”</p><p>This line was a direct reference to a famous statement made by CM Punk during his time with Ring of Honor.</p><p>The wrestling community immediately took notice, and “Corey Graves” became a trending topic on Twitter and other social media platforms. Many fans on these platforms speculated that WWE might be subtly teasing Punk’s highly anticipated return.</p><p>This isn’t the first time WWE has dropped hints that got fans buzzing. Just last month, Cody Rhodes mentioned that Jey Uso “deserves a second chance,” fueling speculation about potential returns. <a href=#>Seth Rollins added to the intrigue when he confidently declared</a>, “my 100% makes me the best in the world” in a recent promo. Even Michael Cole seemed to reference another iconic CM Punk ROH promo during Monday’s RAW.</p><p>While these hints and references have fans excited, it’s important to note that no official confirmation of CM Punk’s return has been made by WWE or Punk himself. Wrestling fans worldwide will be eagerly watching for any further developments and clues as they anticipate the possible comeback of one of wrestling’s most beloved figures.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What are your thoughts on the subtle references and hints towards CM Punk’s return in WWE?
