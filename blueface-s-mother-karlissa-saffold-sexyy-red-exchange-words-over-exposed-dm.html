She frequently throws shade at her grandchildren's mothers, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chrisean Rock</a> and Jaidyn Alexis, as well as whoever else has her feeling some type of way that day. At the end of last year, for example, she dissed <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Sexyy Red</a> for her appearance. It remains unclear exactly what prompted the insults, but she called the St. Louis-born performer "barely cute," and dubbed her <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Stanky Red."</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As expected, the "SkeeYee" rapper was quick to fire back, reminding Karlissa of her alleged altercation with Chrisean Rock. "Didn't Chrisean knot chu df up," she asked. Not too long after dissing the MC, Karlissa walked back her claims. "It's been heavy on my heart to apologize to Sexyy Red because she ain't never done nothing to me or my comedy may have caused her pain," she explained. "I think you are brave and beautiful in your own special way. I'm sorry for offending you because <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I'm not after those who never done anything to me</a>. Please forgive me."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-sexyy-red-tells-blueface-to-get-his-peoples>Sexyy Red Tells Blueface To "Get His Peoples"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It doesn't appear as though the two of them were able to fully sort out their issues, as recently, Sexyy Red took aim at the reality star on her Instagram Story. She shared a DM from Karlissa telling her to give her a call, urging Blueface to "get his peoples." Karlissa later shared the post on her own Story, telling Sexyy she was simply trying to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"make [her] famous."</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">After that, she shared a side-by-side photo of Sexyy Red and herself back in the day. "?She mad ðŸ¤£I was that thang&nbsp;@sexyyred&nbsp;I was trying to give you a few tips baby. Get it LISSA," she captioned the post.
