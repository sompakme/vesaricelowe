One of the few things you can tackle once the game ends is facing the optional bosses and enemies awaiting you in <a href=#>the Lands Between</a>.</p><p>The Red Wolf of the Champion is one of these optional bosses that often go amiss, especially when venturing out near Gelmir Hero's Grave. This guide will detail how to locate and defeat the Red Wolf of the Champion boss in Elden RIng.</p><h2>Where to find the Red Wolf of the Champion in Elden Ring?</h2><p>The Red Wolf of the Champion is an optional boss that players can defeat when exploring the Lands Between. You will easily recognise this boss as a giant red-haired wolf with sorcery-based offensive attacks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/KoeNSgNDrQhCnz3Ly_xQUqUilwdU5CfYIS9P-emLNAM/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9FbGRlbl9SaW5nLzFhX2Jvc3NfZ3VpZGVzL3JlZF93b2xmX29mX3RoZV9jaGFtcGlvbi9lbGRlbl9yaW5nX3JlZF93b2xmX29mX3RoZV9jaGFtcGlvbl9ib3NzX2d1aWRlX2dlbG1pcmVfaGVyb19ncmF2ZV9zaXRlX29mX2dyYWNlX2xvY2F0aW9uX3lvdXR1YmUucG5n><p>You'll need to travel to the Gelmir Hero's Grave <a href=#>Site of Grace</a> to locate the boss. Once at the Site of Grace, head west from the room, down the stairs, and follow the path until you've reached the main chariot hall.</p><p>This hall has a path and lava pools on both sides of this path, with crevices on each side. There will be skeletal enemies that will appear from these crevices, all the while a giant chariot moves towards you, which can be avoided by rolling away into one of the crevices using the adjacent path.</p><p>You'll need to be quick with your movement, as once the chariot passes by, it will come back down the same route. If you land in the lava pool, you will take some fire damage before quickly returning to the main path.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/Y7BZ9q72E2Yz711uXvSKqjUtFpYtfnQJB3ZyCsiniJc/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9FbGRlbl9SaW5nLzFhX2Jvc3NfZ3VpZGVzL3JlZF93b2xmX29mX3RoZV9jaGFtcGlvbi9lbGRlbl9yaW5nX3JlZF93b2xmX29mX3RoZV9jaGFtcGlvbl9ib3NzX2d1aWRlX2dlbG1pcl9oZXJvX2dyYWNlX2NoYXJpb3RfaGFsbF9sYXZhX3lvdXR1YmUucG5n><p>There is a slight platform right of the hall where you can drop down to an area below if you don't go down the hall. You'll need to land on a small ledge below, or you may take significant fall damage or die.</p><p>On this ledge, drop down again, landing in another chariot hall, but watch out for the chariot in this area. Move forward and drop down again, this time, onto another ledge before turning right and right once more down a corridor.</p><p>Make your way across the room where after the doorway, turn around to find a ladder you'll need to climb up. Enter through the right window onto a wooden beam and time your jump to drop onto a chariot below.</p><p></p><p>Once it stops, jump left of the chariot into a small crevice with a ladder. Once at the top, locate a door to the right, which by following the path, will lead you to the golden fog seal. Walk through the seal to enter the boss area for the Red Wolf of the Champion.</p><h2>How to beat Red Wolf of the Champion in Elden Ring?</h2><p>In terms of gameplay strategy, it's pretty similar to the Red Wolf of Radagon boss battle at the Raya Lucaria Academy. That being said, it's resistant to haemorrhage, frostbite and magic attacks while being weak towards physical attacks.</p><p>Before heading into battle, we recommend equipping weaponry that deals physical damage, mainly weapons that scale high in strength. Additionally, Ashes can be used for this boss battle as the Lone Wolf Ashes should help deal some damage while you're evading its attacks and provide much distraction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/fUUO-9Da8Fm11HFlwtNFUTqDKCl-YDjxIUMHqOoJNZE/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9FbGRlbl9SaW5nLzFhX2Jvc3NfZ3VpZGVzL3JlZF93b2xmX29mX3RoZV9jaGFtcGlvbi9lbGRlbl9yaW5nX3JlZF93b2xmX29mX3RoZV9jaGFtcGlvbl9ib3NzX2d1aWRlX2Jvc3NfYXJlbmFfZ29sZGVuX2ZvZ19kb29yX3lvdXR1YmUucG5n><p>Lastly, a shield would be beneficial during this battle, which helps block its magic attacks and reduces the stamina being consumed. Multiplayer is also enabled for this battle, so you can summon help from other players if you're having trouble defeating it.</p><p>Strategy-wise, its moveset is similar to the Red Wolf of Radagon boss. Likewise, the Red Wolf of the Champion is aggressive with its attacks as it makes plenty of leaping and diving attacks.</p><p>If it gets too aggressive or surprises you with a lunge attack, you can use the shield to block them. As such, this boss mainly has combo or chained attacks that you'll need to look out you can avoid getting hit by using the shield, rolling or dodging, or parrying these attacks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/0VE2dKKm0yrq4ldooYTk2Uyd-yzROmZKkIZryoOtMlM/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9FbGRlbl9SaW5nLzFhX2Jvc3NfZ3VpZGVzL3JlZF93b2xmX29mX3RoZV9jaGFtcGlvbi9lbGRlbl9yaW5nX3JlZF93b2xmX29mX3RoZV9jaGFtcGlvbl9ib3NzX2d1aWRlX3NvcmNlcnlfYXR0YWNrc195b3V0dWJlLnBuZw><p>Once these chained attacks end, you roll towards the boss to begin your attacks. Keep up with this strategy as long as you have summoned the Lone Wolves until you've depleted its health meter and defeated the boss.</p><p>The rewards gained from defeating the Red Wolf of the Champion aren't too bad, as you can earn 21,000 Runes and a Sprit summon the Bloodhound Knight Floh Ashes. This spirit possesses an aggressive attack once they've been summoned, which could be helpful when dealing with a difficult boss or enemy.</p><p>You can continue to explore Gelmir Hero's Grave, where there are several notable items worth tracking down. Aside from a handful of weapons, there is a Stonesword Key, the Gelmir Knight gear set and the Deathroot item.</p><p></p><p>We want to thank the YouTube channels <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Gamerpillar</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Boss Showcase</a> for the complete walkthrough of locating and defeating the Red Wolf of the Champion boss in Elden Ring.
