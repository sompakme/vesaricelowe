You have someone wearing an upside-down cross making devil symbols at the biggest cultural event in American history. Everything I said about how you can see demons if you pay attention. Did you look at her and think that's a demon?" Tate said. "But after listening to this, please pay attention. She is wearing an upside-down cross. The matrix has made her famous, nobody knows why, it's certainly not because of fu**ing talent. And she is wearing Balenciaga, which we know are child molesters. And she is making devil symbols! What more, what kind of clue are you looking for if those aren't the clues you need?"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It is an interesting theory but a deeply flawed one at that.
