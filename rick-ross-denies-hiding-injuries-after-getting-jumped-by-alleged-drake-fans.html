Reportedly, he had asked the DJ to play <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kendrick Lamar</a>'s "Not Like Us" at the event, prompting tension among attendees. In footage that circulated online after the incident, he's seen getting punched in the face. Of course, this <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">resulted in an all-out brawl</a> between both crews.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As expected, the viral incident has earned Ross a great deal of clowning online. His ex-wife Tia Kemp has been particularly vocal, making it clear that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">she's on Drizzy's side</a> with various posts. Recently, for example, he shared a photo of himself sipping orange juice on a jet. She took the opportunity to suggest that he was covering up his eye in order to hide injuries from the altercation.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-rick-ross-proves-he-s-uninjured>Rick Ross Proves He's Uninjured</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Hiding that [eye emoji]," she wrote in The Neighborhood Talk's comments section alongside a series of laughing emojis. According to him, however, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he actually is unscathed</a>. To prove it, he's now shared a close-up of both of his eyes, laughing at the idea that he could have been hiding anything. Based on the clip, he didn't walk away with any significant damage, though Kemp is likely to remind him of the attack any chance she gets from now on.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier this week, for example, she said he was glad that the fight happened. She even went on to comment under one of Drake's photos, prompting him to call her his "goat." This got a response from Ross, who simply wrote, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"pedo vs granny."</a> What do you think of Rick Ross getting jumped in Canada over the weekend?
