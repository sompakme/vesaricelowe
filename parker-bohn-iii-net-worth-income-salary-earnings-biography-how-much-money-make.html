He is now ranked sixth all-time in the PBA with 33 career championships, and he has won more over $2.7 million in PBA tournaments, which puts him in fourth place all-time. Aside from that, Bohn took home the $150,000 first-place prize in the 2008 Motel 6 Roll to Riches tournament, although his earnings from that tournament do not count toward his PBA career totals.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>In PBA competition, until the conclusion of the 2011-12 season, he has thrown a total of 88 career perfect 300 games, including one of the PBA’s 22 nationally broadcast 300 games, which came at the 1998 ABC (USBC) Masters in Reno, Nevada. Bohn’s most successful period in his career was from 1997 to 2001-02, during which time he won 18 championships in total, including at least one title in each season. His greatest single season occurred in 1999, when he won five championships and was named PBA Player of the Year as a result of his achievements.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Parker won eight straight televised matches during the 1999 season, which was a career high for him. With a single-season average of 228.03 points, he is the third-best player in history (behind only Norm Duke’s 228.47 points in 2006-07 and Walter Ray Williams’ 228.34 points in 2007-08). Additionally, he was awarded Player of the Year for the 2001-02 season, which was highlighted by the achievement of his first major championship triumph (2001 ABC Masters). Bohn is a four-time recipient of the PBA’s Steve Nagy Sportsmanship Award, which honours outstanding sportsmanship.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>He is a member of the Halls of Fame of both the PBA and the USBC. In January 2013, Bohn earned his second major title at the age of 49, when he won the PBA World Championship in Poland. Dedicated to the promotion of young bowling, Bohn has created the Parker Bohn III Youth Scholarship Tournament, which takes place every year. Since its establishment in 1999, the event has given more than $33,000 in college scholarships to junior bowlers, the majority of whom are from the United States.</p><h2>Parker Bohn III Net Worth : $ 600,000</h2><p>Lets check out updated 2021 Parker Bohn III Net Worth Income Salary report which is given below :</p><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><b>Parker Bohn III’s Salary /&nbsp;</b></span><b>Income</b><b>:</b><p><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><br></span><span><b>Per Year:</b>&nbsp;$ 4,00,000</span></span><br><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><br></span><span><b>Per Month:</b>&nbsp;$ 32,000</span></span><br><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><br></span><span><b>Per Week:</b>&nbsp;$ 8,000</span></span><br><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><br></span></span></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><table><tbody><tr><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Day:</span></b></td><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Hour:</span></b></td><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Minute:</span></b></td><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Second:</span></b></td></tr><tr><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 1140</span></td><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 19</span></td><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 0.3</span></td><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 0.05</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Parker Bohn III Wiki</h2><span>﻿﻿﻿﻿</span><table><tbody><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$600,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 13, 1963</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Freehold, New Jersey, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Bohn, Parker, III</td></tr><tr><td>Star Sign</td><td>Cancer</td></tr></tbody></table><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span> <span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Parker Bohn III FAQ</h2><ul><li>How did Parker Bohn III get so rich?</li><li>What is Parker Bohn III Earning per day ?</li><li>Lets check out Parker Bohn III Wife / Husand Net Worth ?</li><li>How much does Parker Bohn III make per day?</li><li>How much Parker Bohn III Net Worth ?</li><li>How Parker Bohn III become rich ?</li><li>How does Parker Bohn III make money ?</li><li>What is Parker Bohn III Income ?</li><li>How much Parker Bohn III Salary ?</li><li>How old is Parker Bohn III Age ?</li><li>How tall is Parker Bohn III Height ?</li><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZnxxhY6pmKujlad6o7vHp2SioZliu6bAjLCmq6yYYravr86mnGarkaGus8WMnpirppmjtLR5waKmoKqRpbW6eceormalpZi1brnOp5yyZZ2WuKZ6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
