At the time she brought out friends like Kenzo B, Flo Milli, and Kaliii, which ultimately sparked a Twitter debate about why the artist with the fairest complexion has also been given the most opportunities. Elsewhere, some have criticized her for "lip syncing" at the event – reviews she's also receiving for this weekend's stop at Governor's Ball.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ice-spice-wears-double-denim-for-governor-s-ball>Ice Spice Wears Double Denim For Governor's Ball</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While her endless twerking certainly caught the internet's attention, several video clips prove how hard it can be to hear Spice over her music at times. Even so, she's obviously taken note of those criticizing her performing abilities, turning up the heat with some of her most bootylicious choreography to date.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It's certainly no RENAISSANCE World Tour, but still, the "Bikini Bottom" hitmaker has proven she's willing to persevere and grow as her career continues to flourish. She previously hinted at sharing her debut album in 2023, though we have yet to hear any updates on that project in recent weeks.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">Fans React</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Keep scrolling to see Twitter's thirsty reactions to Ice Spice's latest performance at Governor's Ball 2023.
