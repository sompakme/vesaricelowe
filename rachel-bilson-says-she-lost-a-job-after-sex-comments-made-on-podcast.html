This is the first time it’s ever happened to me in my professional life that I lost a job this week because of things that were said and then spun in the press and clickbait headlines and whatnot. I lost my first job.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She goes on to explain, “A job got taken away from me because I was speaking candidly and openly about sex in a humorous way on our friend’s podcast… I basically got a job, that I already had, pulled from me because I was speaking openly about sex.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She says that “in this day and age” she’s “baffled” by the decision, reiterating, “A single mom, a woman, lost a job because they were being candid and honest and the subject was sex. I didn’t even have a chance to defend myself.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The comments Bilson refers to are from her interview on the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Women On Top&nbsp;podcast</a>, where she discussed her&nbsp;favorite and least favorite sex positions. After sharing that she likes to be “manhandled,” Bilson later clarified that it was meant to be a lighthearted statement.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“First of all, I said it in a joking manner in the interview, like, ‘Yeah, I wanna get fucking manhandled.’ Basically, it’s like, okay give control or take control in the bedroom, whatever,” she explains on Broad Ideas.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Because that specific line was pulled and it made it sound a certain way, I didn’t even have a chance to defend myself. I didn’t have a chance to speak on it,” she says, later explaining that the brand [she was involved with] “said they weren’t comfortable with that headline … I feel like it’s discrimination.” She also says she felt “shamed” by the unnamed company.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Bilson does not disclose what the job was. A rep for Bilson tells The Hollywood Reporter that it was an endorsement deal.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She also admits that she “cried” after everything and reflects on how this experience has impacted her family: “I’m a single mom. Like I need these jobs … everything counts. You know, I provide a lot for my family — my daughter — and regardless of anything else, it all matters.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Bilson recalls growing up in “a very open household where things were talked about” and sex being discussed “in a sacred way.” However, after losing this job, she says she is still feeling “floored.” “Everything was set in motion and I lost the job. It sucks,” she adds.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Regardless of what happened, Bilson stands by her comments saying, “I haven’t said anything inappropriate. Choice of language, if I could go back, now knowing that I lost a job, maybe I would say it differently. But I still wouldn’t not say it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>May 18, 1:21 p.m.</strong> Updated with comment from Bilson’s rep.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLOtwqGcpWWSnrm0u81mo6irpGK3sK6MrJyxZZOkuq6xza2qZqifmbCiv9NmaGtrZWmGdoCVcWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
