"I mean, I knew it to be true," Josephs later told <a href=#>Page Six</a> about the bomb she dropped. "I've known for a long time.

It should be noted, however, that Cohen did not have to flip a table or throw glassware across at anyone to get his point across. Giudice, take notes.&nbsp;</p><p>Be sure and tune in next week for part three as we're sure the drama will continue to unfold.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcW5gZYJ1e8Cnm7Jlk6S1prqMnKamqJyawaa42GajmquYmsBuu9StZJqsXam1pnnCmqqtZZ%2BberO0zqehaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
