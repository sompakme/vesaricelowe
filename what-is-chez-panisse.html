 Answer
Chez Panisse is a restaurant in Berkeley, California, that is widely regarded as one of the primary sources of inspiration for the style of cooking known as California cuisine. It is the food, rather than the approach, that the restaurant emphasises, and it has built a supply network based on direct partnerships with local farmers, ranchers, and dairy producers.
