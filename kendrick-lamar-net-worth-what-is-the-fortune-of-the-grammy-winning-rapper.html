Last Sunday, he won the <strong><a href=#>Grammy </a></strong>for best rap album after another successful year. His skills are now compared to only the best rappers in music history. The name <strong>Kendrick Lamar</strong> is now synonym of other names such as <strong>Dr. Dre, Tupac, Sneep Dogg, Notorious B.I.G. or Eminem</strong>. Kendrick was already considered a great rapper but this past year made him one of the greats.</p><p>With all that critical success, there is also the financial success that comes with selling millions of albums or makes him one of the most listened artists on every streaming platform. This begs the question of how much is Kendrick Lamar truly worth. He was born in <strong>Compton, California on June 17, 1987</strong>. His full name is <strong>Kendrick Lamar Duckworth</strong> and he started rapping since he was in elementary school. With idols like Tupac or Dr. Dre, Lamar set the bar pretty high from the beginning.</p><p></p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>How much is Kendrick Lamar worth?</h2><p>According to <strong>Forbes</strong>, Kendrick Lamar has an estimated net worth of <strong>$75 million</strong> but he has earned over $180 million throughout his entire career. Since he started his music career in the early '2000s, he appeared on dozens of singles that featured many popular artists such as <strong>Big Sean, Robin Thicke, Drake, 2 Chainz, Birdman, and J. Cole</strong>. But the best was yet to come in 2015 after many different collaborations placed him at a comfrotable position.</p><p>'<strong>To Pimp a Butterfly</strong>' was released in 2015 and it became #1 on the Billboard 200 chart in the <strong>United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the entire United Kingdom</strong>. Critically, this is considered one of the best rap/hip-hop albums of all-time and won multiple <strong><a href=#>Grammys </a></strong>as well. Since then, it's only been home runs from Kendrick and his entire production team. His talent is the main reason he is worth $75 million right now. But Lamar is still 35 years of age, his career still has a long road ahead and many more great songs he will share to the world.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6cnKWdkqe2tcWMp5ytZaekv7W0jmtna2tfZX9wfJZobWydYm2CdnyRb2%2Bea5Vos3J8l5trbplhY7W1ucs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
