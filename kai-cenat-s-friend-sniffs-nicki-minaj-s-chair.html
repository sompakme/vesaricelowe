Despite the weirdness, Minaj's appearance was a rousing success for Cenat."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While Cenat and his crew found it hilarious, most commenters online thought it was weird and childish. "N-ggas is weird, I swear they been doing this since middle school," one person summarized on Instagram.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite the weirdness, Minaj's appearance was a rousing success for Cenat. Minaj was loving the chaotic vibes and wealth of attention. At one point, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Minaj sent chat wild by furiously twerking at the camera</a>. Furthermore, the pair broke Cenat's single-stream viewership record. According to Stream Charts, the stream peaked at 348,593 viewers. Cenat typically averages around 34K for a regular stream. His previous record was just over 306,000 viewers. Did you catch the stream? What did you think? Who do you want to see Cenat stream with next? Let us know in the comments below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kai-cenat-trolls-rubi-rose>Kai Cenat Trolls Rubi Rose</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Elsewhere, Cenat continued his charade of pretending that he had bought Rubi Rose a genuine Birkin bag. The streamer called up the rapper and influencer to show her the bag while he was live. Rose appeared skeptical, saying she knew it was from Temu. However, Cenat insisted it was real and appeared to get Rose to believe him. Despite this, Cenat laughed giddily and slapped his desk multiple times after ending the call, confirming the bag was indeed a fake.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The ruse was put in motion a few weeks ago when Cenat hit up Rose, Corinna Kopf, and Pokimane <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">with the offer to buy them all Birkin bags</a>. However, while talking to the three women, he was simultaneously showing his stream chat his screen, which was on the dropshipping website Temu. It's unclear if the three women are in on the joke or are victims of Cenat's prank.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.
