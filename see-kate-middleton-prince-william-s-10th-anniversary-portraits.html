Taken in the grounds of Kensington Palace earlier this week, the couple appear at ease as they smile for the cameras. With her signature blown-out locks, Kate is dressed for the summer in a delicate, pale blue wrap dress.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Visible in both photographs is the stunning engagement ring Kate first revealed during their royal engagement portraits in October 2010. Featuring a 12-carat oval blue sapphire and fourteen diamonds, the 18-karat white gold ring has a deep meaning for both the duke and duchess, as it belonged to Princess Diana. At the time of his engagement, William said giving the ring to his wife-to-be was his way of making sure his mother wouldn’t miss out on their wedding day. Since their engagement, the ring—now valued at over $400,000–became one of the world’s most sought-after styles for more than a decade.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">William’s watch also holds significance. The prince’s mid-size OMEGA Seamaster Quartz, believed to be a gift from his late mother, was the timepiece he wore to his 2011 wedding. It has rarely been off his wrist since.</p><img alt="embargoed until 2230hrs bst april 28th 2021 the duke and duchess of cambridgea new portrait of the duke and duchess of cambridge taken at kensington palace this week to mark their 10th wedding anniversary obligatory credit line must be observed photo by chris floydcamera press this image is provided for free editorial use in connection with the anniversary until may 12th 2021 it must then be removed from your databases thereafter it will be available only via camera press strictly editorial news only, no commercial, souvenir or promotional use permitted magazine cover usages require approval no print sales the photograph cannot be cropped, manipulated or altered in any way" title="10th Wedding Anniversary of Duke and Duchess of Cambridge" width=3375 height=4500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/camera-press-04148445-1619644468.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Chris Floyd</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While the Cambridges often enjoy low-key celebrations for their anniversaries, their tenth—traditionally marked in the U.K. with gifts made of tin—has seen the couple bring their milestone on the road. On Tuesday, William and Kate visited a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a36263869/kate-middleton-farm-visit-look/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="family-run farm" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">family-run farm</a> in the English countryside. The local business featured an initiative funded by one of the 26 charities chosen by the couple in 2011 to benefit from donations made to their royal wedding charitable gift fund.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Key—formerly known as Keyfund—received $46,000 (£33,000) from the gift fund and allowed the organization to hire an extra member of staff and expand their projects. William and Kate’s time with the “Cheesy Waffles Project” at Manor Farm in County Durham—which helps children and young people with additional needs “transition to a happy and health adulthood”—allowed the duke and duchess to see the impact of their financial support.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/45770d72-fac8-4474-90bb-36e121ad9a67_1543445615.jpeg alt="Headshot of Omid Scobie" title="Headshot of Omid Scobie" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Omid Scobie is <a href=#>BAZAAR.com</a>’s Royal Editor at Large and has covered the lives and philanthropic work of the younger members of the British Royal Family for over eight years.
