This is how you want to be portrayed?” the riled local continued. “Stand up to this bullshit! I'm from Philly — I actually should support Meek Mill.

This is disgusting!”</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>While the debate as to whether Meek Mill was right or wrong to have wrapped that vehicle with his sexually graphic album cover is a worthwhile conversation, the backlash against the artwork as a standalone piece prompts a different discussion. From John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s </span><span>Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins</span><span> in 1968 to Halsey’s newly released album </span><span>If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power</span><span>, nudity and sexually explicit imagery have been present on album covers for decades.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Naturally, the shock of seeing body parts that are typically kept private has resulted in several iconic album covers being condemned by fans and critics alike, and as a result, many artists have been forced to partially censor their artwork or change the covers entirely. While many consumers understandably want to shield youth from nude imagery, that perspective often doesn’t translate to settings where nudity is framed as high art, like in Francois Clouet’s 16th-century painting, </span><span>Gabrielle d'Estrées et une de ses sœurs</span><span>.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Speaking to that point,&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Killer Mike recently came forward</a> to defend Meek Mill’s album cover for </span><span>Expensive Pain</span><span>. “It's art,” the Run the Jewels rapper and activist argued. “We as a society see naked humans in art in museums. We should also be cultured enough as adults and parents to have a convo about nudity and art with our children. I say this as a parent, rapper and a High Museum of ART Board member.”</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong><span>Regardless of how you personally feel about the use of nudity in album artwork, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">popular album covers are going to be scrutinized</a>, whether artists go the Drake route with playful, kid-friendly artwork or the Meek Mill route with sexually explicit imagery. In light of the discourse that the controversial </span><span>Expensive Pain </span><span>artwork has sparked, here is a survey of some of the most NSFW album covers in Hip-Hop history.</span></strong></p><p><h2>Luke - In The Nude (1993)</h2></p><p>Luke/Lil Joe Records</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong><span>Anyone familiar with Uncle Luke’s legacy knows about his Miami-based Hip-Hop group 2 Live Crew and the boundaries that they pushed with albums like 1988’s </span><span>Move Somethin'</span><span> and 1989’s </span><span>As Nasty as They Wanna Be</span><span>. While 2 Live Crew’s most controversial album covers primarily featured bikini-clad women, Uncle Luke’s 1993 solo album was even more graphic, especially considering the time period in which it was released. On the uncensored version of the cover, Luke and four women pose completely nude in a bathtub, with soap suds and strategic hand placements keeping the cover from becoming too X-rated.</span></strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>Master P - The Ghetto’s Tryin to Kill Me!

The New Orleans trailblazer’s cover is one of the rare instances in which a rapper is portrayed having sex in their album artwork, and while it didn’t feature any explicit nudity, it’s a great example of how Hip-Hop has used NSFW imagery in an artistic way.</span></strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong><span>Furthermore, Master P’s iconic album artwork also influenced the cover of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Freddie Gibbs</a>’ 2009 compilation album </span><span>The Labels Tryin' to Kill Me: The Best of Freddie Gibbs</span><span>.</span></strong></p><p>A Brief History Of Nudity & Sexually Explicit Imagery In Hip-Hop Album Artwork</p><p><h6>Freddie Gibbs</h6><h2>Ice-T - Gangsta Rap (2006)</h2></p><p>Ice-T/Ice Touring</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong><span>In contrast to Master P’s </span><span>The Ghettos Tryin to Kill Me!</span><span>, Ice-T’s final studio album left little to the imagination. </span><span>Gangsta Rap</span><span> arrived in 2006, and its cover was an intimate photo of the rapper-turned-actor and his wife Coco Austin laying in bed fully nude.</span></strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>Kanye West - My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010)</h2></p><p>A Brief History Of Nudity & Sexually Explicit Imagery In Hip-Hop Album Artwork</p><p><h6><strong>Kanye West/George Condo/UMG Recordings, Inc.</strong></h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong><span>One of the paintings that George Condo created for </span><span>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy </span><span>shifted away from real-life depictions of sex and nudity in exchange for an image of monstrous-looking Kanye drinking a beer and having sex with a nude, winged creature.
