However, it appears that his role is transitioning, and Ross may be entering the quieter stages of his career. Known for his iconic voice and commentary in WWE, he brought his talent to AEW.</p><p>Observant fans have noticed that Ross is not as active on AEW as he once was. While he used to announce for Dynamite and certain pay-per-view events, he now appears less frequently on Dynamite and more often on AEW’s one-hour show, Rampage. Despite this shift, Jim has made it clear that he is not finished and desires to take on one more significant project before embracing a quieter phase of his career. His sights are set on the upcoming All In event, which has the potential to be the year’s biggest pay-per-view.</p><p>However, Ross is uncertain about his specific role for the event. In a recent episode of <a href=#>Grilling JR</a>, Ross shared that his assignment remains unclear, but he is eagerly looking forward to the event.</p><p>“I’m excited about it,” expressed Ross. “I’m glad I’m going. I don’t know what I’m doing. That’s the great thing about my career. I’ve done it all, without sounding like a jerk. All roles. I’ve done color, I’ve done play-by-play, I’ve been a host, blah blah blah. So I don’t know what I’m doing, but it doesn’t matter. I’ll be a part of the event,” he continued, “and that’s what’s going to be cool as hell. Guys like me, I don’t know how many more rodeos I’ve got.”</p><p>As Jim Ross potentially enters the latter stages of his career, fans can only hope to continue hearing his iconic commentary. Ross’s presence enhances moments in professional wrestling, and it would be exciting to witness more iconic moments being made in AEW with his contributions.</p><p>What are your thoughts on Jim Ross potentially entering the quieter stages of his career and his desire to take on one more significant project before embracing a quieter phase?
