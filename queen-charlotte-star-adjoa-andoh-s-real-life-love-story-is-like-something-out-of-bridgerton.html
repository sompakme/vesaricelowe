"I had a theatre company called Wild Iris. We had a tiny little office at the centre. One of our directors came in one day to say someone was taking over the bookstore downstairs, and that he was tasty,' the Bridgerton star recalled. 'We went in and there was Howard. He was this very smiley man behind the till in a patch of sunshine."</p><p id=e1Ujo4sDCKV data-wc=43>What Adjoa didn't realise, however, was that Howard had already spotted her while moving into the shop below. "There was a lovely staircase that went up to the offices. I'd seen Adjoa come down those stairs and I lost my head," he gushed.&nbsp;</p><p id=eVP2f_HfjQ data-wc=9><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Queen Charlotte star Ruth Gemmell's famous ex-husband revealed</a></p><p id=eJc-vhGIyVe data-wc=10><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Queen Charlotte creator Shonda Rhimes teases another Bridgerton spin-off</a></p><p id=eVK3krHVZ0s data-wc=45>Initially, the pair had formed a sweet friendship, with Howard spending time with both Adjoa and her daughter in the bookstore, but it was after Howard came to watch Adjoa perform in the play, 'Death Catches the Hunter,' that he realised he wanted something more.&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=exR5fhTUH6a data-wc=67>In a heartwarming moment, after a positive review of the show was released in , he decided to cut it out and kept it in his wallet. At the end of 1995, just before Christmas, he also visited Adjoa at her home and suggested they start dating. Sharing a number of common interests, the couple quickly bonded over their shared love of the arts and football.&nbsp;</p><p id=eJF54b3NUiv data-wc=74>A year later, Adjoa and Howard had their first child together, and by 1997, they had welcomed a second. Their wedding took place at St Saviours Church in Herne Hill in 2001, and this year they're set to celebrate 22 years of marriage. Currently, Adjoa and Howard are based in Brixton, south London, but they told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Guardian</a> that being with each other is what truly feels like home – talk about couple goals.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/9f0cf8309f62-adjoa-andoh-naacp-image-award.jpg><p id=eJ3E6Je2wRs data-wc=61>Adjoa has also opened up about the "modernist" home that she shares with Howard in London. Describing her approach to interiors, she told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Good Housekeeping</a>: "It's got lots of wood, pictures, and wall-to-wall books. It's gallery-red all over, open plan and modernist. I grew up in a rural Cotswolds village, so there are definitely some Cotswolds vibes to my home, too."</p><p id=eSrehHWp28c data-wc=45>Asked about her go-to pick-me-up, the 60-year-old replied: "I have a new special thing that lifts my spirits, which is a video of my six-month-old grandson laughing. It goes on for about three minutes where he's just giggling relentlessly and it's such a joyful thing."&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Meet the cast of Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a764031a73ed-queen-charlotte-india.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cfe98245abe3-queen-charlotte-corey.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a10e95612079-queen-charlotte-arsemajpg.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b7d87340f935-queen-charlotte-ruth.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ff46e41be8da-adjoa-andoh-queen-charlotte.jpg><p id=e4Nw8vxwEH data-wc=26><strong>Don't want to miss a story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our What to Watch newsletter</a> and get the heads-up on the shows and films everyone’s talking about.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tcGtsZm18ssHEnqVmm5iWv627062cZquklr9urcOjppplkaOxsLSMpaavnV2owbC%2B2GauoqyYYrW2v8GapZ1lmKTEor7DZpqupp6aua17</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
