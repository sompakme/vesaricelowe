"I loved everything about him,” she continued. “He was honest. You understand? One thing about him, even at that young age… honest! Yo, I respect it. I’m like, I can’t take nothing else.” She went on to share a story of how she asked her late husband if he had cheated on her, and he came clean. According to her,<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> honesty is the best policy</a>, especially when it comes to infidelity.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-faith-evans-opens-up-about-her-and-biggie-s-relationship>Faith Evans Opens Up About Her And Biggie's Relationship</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">She recalled asking her husband, “Did you f*ck her?” and he revealed the truth. Evans claims he was “honest as f*ck,” even when it came to tough situations like cheating. “Most of the time I didn’t know what was going on," she says. "But when I did and I asked him, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he told the truth</a>.” As expected, her response raised some eyebrows. Regardless, she continues to reflect on the positives of her relationship with the rapper, who passed away in 1997.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As for Evans' current relationships, she recently officially <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">ended her marriage</a> with her third husband, Stevie J. The duo battled things out in court for a while before reaching a settlement back in July. The duo tied the knot in 2018 after being friends for more than two decades. According to reports, they were dealing with some "Irreconcilable differences" that drove them apart.
