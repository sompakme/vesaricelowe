Opie's story had been tragic from the start, doing time for the club, and eventually losing his wife and his father at the hands of club members. When the club is forced to choose one of its members to be brutally killed in prison, Opie volunteers, saving Jax's life.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Donna Winston</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Sprague_Grayden.jpg><p>The woman that launched a thousand ships, Donna Winston's (<strong>Sprague Grayden</strong>) death could arguably be the event that sparked the fracturing of SAMCRO. Tig (<strong>Kim Coates</strong>) was told by Clay (<strong>Ron Perlman</strong>) to kill Opie (<strong>Ryan Hurst</strong>), but mistakenly kills Donna instead. The death of his wife and the mother of his two children leads Opie down a dark path and also results in the murders of several other characters on the show, including Agent Stahl, who had set up Opie to look like an informant in the first place.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Piney Winston</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Piney_Winston.jpg><p>Piney Winston (<strong>William Lucking</strong>) was a founding member of the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, and also the father of Opie (<strong>Ryan Hurst</strong>), another member of the club. He became progressively more suspicious of Clay (<strong>Ron Perlma</strong>n) and more disenchanted with the club as time went on. When Piney threatened Clay with letters that proved he killed Jax's father, Clay visited Piney at his cabin and killed him. Clay staged it to look like Piney was killed by the Lobos Sonara.<br>&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Luann Delaney</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Luann_Delaney.jpg><p>Luann Delaney (<strong>Dendrie Taylor</strong>) was Gemma's (<strong>Katey Sagal</strong>) best friend and a porn producer. She was killed after a rivalry with another producer got heated. Her husband, Otto (<strong>Kurt Sutter</strong>), demanded that the club avenge his old lady's murder, which leads to a complicated unfolding of events, with fellow SAMCRO member Bobby (<strong>Mark Boone Junior</strong>) lying to Otto, and Otto then turning on Bobby and the club.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>A.J. Weston</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/A_J_Weston.jpg><p>A.J. Weston (<strong>Henry Rollins</strong>) was a proud father figure, dedicated member of the white supremacist group League of American Nationalists and rapist. After Gemma (<strong>Katey Sagal</strong>) realized that Weston was the leader of the group of men who brutally raped her, we figured his time in Charming would be up sooner rather than later. In the season 2 finale, SAMCRO was able to corner him in a tattoo parlor bathroom and Jax (<strong>Charlie Hunnam</strong>) killed him with a silenced pistol.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Kip “Half Sack” Epps</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Kip_Half_Sack_Epps.jpg><p>Half Sack (<strong>Johnny Lewis</strong>) was the lovable and loyal SAMCRO prospect who was killed in the season two finale when he tried to protect baby Abel from Cameron Hayes (<strong>Jamie McShane</strong>). Creator Kurt Sutter said that his decision to kill of Half Sack was not "to be sensational and kill off a main character" but because Lewis was not happy on the show.</p><p>"Creatively, he really wanted out of his contract. We had ongoing conversations, and we decided we'd find some noble way for him to go," Sutter said.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>David Hale</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/David_Hale.jpg><p>Police officer David Hale (<strong>Taylor Sheridan</strong>) was a pretty straight-laced guy, who was slowly coming around to the questionable ways of SAMCRO. While holding watch at the funeral of Half-Sack, Hale was killed by a drive-by shooting. It was one of the most surprising, and almost random, deaths ever on the FX show.<strong></strong></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>June Stahl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/June_Stahl.jpg><p>One of the many strong female characters on the show was June Stahl (<strong>Ally Walker</strong>), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent who was determined to take down SAMCRO and the groups they did business with. After her actions led to the kidnapping for Jax's child and the death of Opie's wife Donna, she became the target of a complicated plan of attack by SAMCRO. She ended up begging for her life, but Opie still shot her in the back of the head, the same way that Donna was killed.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Jimmy O’Phelan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Titus_Welliver.jpg><p>The leader of the Real IRA group, Jimmy O'Phelan (<strong>Titus Welliver</strong>), had a long history with SAMCRO member Chibs (<strong>Tommy Flanagan</strong>) — and by "long history" we mean he kicked Chibs out of the Real IRA, banished him from Ireland, stole his wife and scarred up his face. After Jimmy tried to kill SAMCRO members on more than one occasion, and then used Jax's son as leverage to get safe passage out of Ireland, he was eventually betrayed by the Russians and handed over to SAMCRO. Chibs got to have his revenge, carving a Glasgow Smile onto his face and then stabbing him to death.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>Herman Kozik</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Herman_Kozik.jpg><p>Herman Kozik (<strong>Kenny Johnson</strong>), who patched into the Charming chapter of Sons of Anarchy in season three, always had a beef with Tig (<strong>Kim Coates)</strong> — and it turned out if was over a dog named Missy. Kozik was killed after he stepped on a land mine while in a fight with Lobo Cartel. His final words: "You gotta be shittin' me!"</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Georgie Caruso</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Georgie.jpg><p>Georgie Caruso (<strong>Tom Arnold</strong>) was a rival of Luann Delaney's (<strong>Dendrie Taylor</strong>) in the porn business. When Luann was found beaten to death, it became clear that Georgie had something to do with it. He escaped death at the end of season two by fleeing to Thailand to find new talent. In season four, he returned with a new business plan involving life-sized sex dolls, but after making promises he couldn't keep to SAMCRO, SAMCRO executed him in the trunk of his car.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Sons_of_Anarchy_Clay_a_p.jpg></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Sons_of_Anarchy_Tara_a_p.jpg></li></ul><p>ad</p><p>{{ result.published_at | date: "%h %d, %Y" }}</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8aao6Wdoq58tLvNrGSappGnsKnFjJ2cmqyYqHqktMCro6KdXZ3Cr7rApmRsbmVsgXp7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
