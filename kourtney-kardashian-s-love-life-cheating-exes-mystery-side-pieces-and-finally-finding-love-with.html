Let's take a closer look at Kourtney Kardashian's relationships.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/885651964210457f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Wedding bells: 4 Nigerian celebrities who have said yes and will be walking the aisle soon</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/885651964210457f.jpg><h2>Scott Disick: Kourtney's forever soulmate</h2><p class=align-left>Kourt and Scott have an insanely long relationship history. The former flames actually met in Mexico in 2006 when Joe Francis, the creator of <i>Girls Gone Wild </i>threw a party for all his notable celebrity friends. From that day on it seems romance quickly blossomed between the young lovebirds and Scott Disick would even feature on the family's reality show the very next year.</p><p class=align-left>Since 2007, fans have been watching the couple together on <i>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</i> and for a while, it looked like they were absolutely inseparable. The close-knit Kardashian clan welcomed Scott, unlike any other family boyfriend, inviting him on overseas trips and genuinely including him as a member of the household.</p><p class=align-left>But things took a turn for the worse and in March 2008 Kourtney would accuse Scott of cheating for the first of many times. On the Season 2 premiere of <i>KUWTK</i>, Kourtney actually found texts from another woman on his phone, <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">US Weekly</a></i> reports.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fa36df59b1e10483.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rita Dominic, Kemi Adetiba, other celebrities whose weddings took place in the first 5 months of 2022</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After dumping the serial cheater, the couple announced they'd reconciled in August of 2009. Kourtney welcomed their first child, Mason just a few short months later and despite the relationship drama, she gushed about the joys of becoming a mother:</p>"I love being pregnant. I feel like it's going by too fast. It is the best thing that's happened to me. It's such a spiritual thing happening in your body," she told the publication.<p class=align-left>Over the course of their 9-year long relationship, the couple has welcomed two more beautiful children- a daughter named Penelope and a little boy named Reign. However, Scott's continued struggles with drugs, alcohol and multiple counts of infidelity have made a healthy relationship impossible.</p><p class=align-left>In 2015 the couple officially spilt for good and embarked on a new journey of friendship and co-parenting for the sake of their kids, <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Harpers Baazar </a></i>reports.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1476e0b3961bf54d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Yara Shahidi, Anthony Anderson, Ludacris & Megan Thee Stallion bag degrees, secure their futures</span></p></a><h2>Younes Bendjima: The model with a wandering eye</h2><p class=align-left>Between 2017 and 2018 Kourtney briefly dated boxer-turned-model, Younes Bendjima. It was a serious cougar situation as Kardashian was a whopping 14-years older than her boy toy!</p><p class=align-left>Still, things seemed great for the couple until pictures of Younes cuddling up to a mystery woman in Mexico were leaked to the paparazzi, <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Capital FM</a></i> reports.</p><h3>Scott tries to bond with Younes in the most inappropriate way</h3><p class=align-left>Younes and Disick actually had social media users laughing in 2021 when Scott tried to have a little talk in the DMS about Kourtney's new boyfriend, Travis Barker.</p><p class=align-left>Scott appeared to be insulting Kourtney's new relationship and he felt the amount of PDA was just super inappropriate, <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a></i> reports.

At the time, Travis was dating heiress, Paris Hilton so naturally, the friends ran in similar circles.</p>â€œHow could you not stare at Kim? Mind you, I enjoyed hanging out with Paris, but I love curvy girls. Kim was eye candy," he said at the time.<p class=align-left>He even claims to have given Kim advice when she was originally approached by Ryan Seacrest for the launch of <i>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</i>.</p><p class=align-left>Years later, Kourtney and Travis sparked dating rumours when they were spotted out and about in Malibu grabbing lunch together, <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Glamour</a></i> reports. It's alleged the couple have been friends "for years."</p><p class=align-left>Things get Insta-serious in January 2021 when Travis drops a rose emoji under one of Kourtney's selfies.

As previously seen on <i>The Kardashians</i>, the couple in their 40s are currently trying for a child together.</p><p class=align-left>The journey to true love has always been a little unconventional for the oldest Kardashian sister.
