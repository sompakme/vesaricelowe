During a 2015 interview, Reynolds was asked about his friend's feud with Angelina Jolie, and "The Longest Yard" star did not hold back. "Jon Voight is so special, and he doesn't deserve the kind of treatment that his daughter's given to him," he said while appearing on <a href=#>"Loose Women."</a> In fact, Reynolds recalled trying to warn Voight about his daughter from a young age. "I remember when she was 10 years old... and I went over to Jon and said, 'You're in big trouble, she is going to be wild.'" Reynolds then explained how "lucky" he was to have a well-behaved son himself.</p><p dir=ltr>The comments came several years after Voight and Jolie famously made amends in 2011. "It gave me back my daughter and my family. Being reunited with my Angie is very precious to me," the "Anaconda" actor told the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> at the time. According to reports, Jolie wanted her kids to have a relationship with their grandfather.</p><p dir=ltr>Following his interview on Voight and Jolie's fractured relationship, Reynolds changed his tune about the "Girl, Interrupted"&nbsp;actor.&nbsp;He half-jokingly endorsed both Voight and his daughter as presidential candidates. "I like her a lot. She's not afraid to tackle anything, and she's a very, very sweet girl," Reynolds told the <a href=#>Daily Beast</a> in 2016. Over the years, Voight and Jolie managed to maintain&nbsp;the truce and build a relationship.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampjZ4F1g46brKusXaeyurrOpZusZaSkvKx5wGaapZ2Rp3q0tcOeZKKmXZa7qLHLoqWaZZqkuaqx0madnq2UYsSqwMdmn56qXZmupXnJqKVmrp%2BetKnAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
