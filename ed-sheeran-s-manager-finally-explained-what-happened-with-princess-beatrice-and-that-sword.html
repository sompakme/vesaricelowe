The place: Royal Lodge, Windsor. The incident: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">Princess Beatrice</a> reportedly slashing crooner <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Ed Sheeran's</a> face with a sword during a mock knighting ceremony. It's not a twisted game of Clue or the plot to a new Netflix limited series. It's apparently what happened at a party and why Sheeran has a scar below his right eye. Though there have been tales contesting the situation, Sheeran's manager, Stuart Camp, finally gave his version of the story.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Camp explains that he chose not to speak publicly about the incident — and that was on purpose. But it seems enough time has passed that he's comfortable revealing his take on the turn of events.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I got quite protective over that, because we've never publicly commented on it," Camp said during an appearance on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Straight Up podcast</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Thomas Niedermueller / Stringer</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Camp went on to say that he was advised to just make something else up, though he ended up just keeping quiet about the entire thing and having stories <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">swirl around the internet</a> with no clear answers. But Camp laid it all out: according to him, Beatrice did, in fact, cut open Sheeran's cheek with a decorative sword. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Sun</a> reported that Sheeran's friend James Blunt had asked to be knighted and Beatrice, being the kind princess that she is, obliged, only Sheeran was in the line of fire and while his friend earned a title, he had to get stitches.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Certain people said, 'Oh, you should lie and say it wasn't her and say it was someone else,'" he explained. "I said, 'well, we're not telling anyone anything. I'm not lying, just because someone's a fucking idiot and they've been waving a sword around when you're all drunk. It's not safe!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Camp said that the situation seems outrageous, but given the circumstances (royalty, pop stars, alcohol, revelry, etc.), it was bound to happen eventually.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I know, we'll get paralytic and take a sword off the wall and wave it around the room,'" he joked. "When you hang out with those sort of circles you're just asking for trouble, aren't you?"</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mike Marsland</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the incident, Blunt claimed that the whole thing was made up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Ed was drunk, messing around, and he cut himself," Blunt told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">ShortList</a> in 2017. "We made a fancy story up; people fell for it. It was very embarrassing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Blunt went on to say that he felt bad for Sheeran, who did end up with a scar somehow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"All of it [was made up]," Blunt added. "Apart from the actual scar. It’s bizarre that people fell for it. I blame him. He must be desperate — he's trying to sell records."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for Sheeran, he claimed that it really did happen. When he stopped by the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Graham Norton Show</a> in 2017, he laid out all the facts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I can't talk about it. I don’t know what will happen if I do!" he said, adding, "I have no idea how it came out as there weren't a lot of people there that night. For two weeks after, I had a huge gash on my face and would tell people I fell, and then suddenly, the story came out. The alleged story came out."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8SdZKyglZq%2ForqOnptmq5iasrOtzWakmqaRnLKzec%2BroKeblajAbq7EmquroZOaerTDzqub</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
